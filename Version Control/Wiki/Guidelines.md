		1. Have you published an educational video on Marxism? Designed a poster related to socialism? Feel more than welcome to share it with us. Moderators may decide to temporarily sticky those posts in order to increase exposure.

Know about a future demonstration against the patriarchal system? Let other comrades know and increase organization. Moderators may decide to temporarily sticky those posts in order to increase exposure. Note: When posting about organizing efforts that you’re involved with, its suggested that you take reasonable steps to preserve your anonymity and that of your comrades.
	3. Articles related to Socialism or current events from a socialist perspective.
		1. Furthermore, please consider keeping titles non-editorialized unless its to further clarify the topic of the article or correct inaccuracies (Example: Don't change "The EZLN announces a territorial expansion in middle of a conflict with ALMO" to "Long live the Caracoles and Juntas de Buen Gobierno!"), as well as providing alternative lectures to paywalled content whenever possible.

		1. Photographs that immortalize historic events of the workers struggle, such as the USSR flag flying over the Reichstag, CNT-FAI militias in barricades during the Spanish Civil War, Cienfuegos moving into Havana, etc. This also includes "This day in history" posts as a tool of remembrance of historical events.

2. Disallowed Submissions
		1. Submissions that fall into any of the categories below, will be removed. The [General Bans Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/index/generalbans) also applies here.
	1. Low Effort Images: 
		1. [r/Socialism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism) generally does not allow low effort image posts (including memes), as our focus is on hosting more serious content. If in doubt, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/socialism). Want to post some memes? Check out our sidebar for several examples of left-wing humour subreddits. 
	2. 101 questions: 
		1. While we generally welcome educational posts, questions about the fundamentals of socialism belong in [r/socialism_101](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism_101), a dedicated community which will provide a better learning environment.
	3. Promotion of liberal politicians or parties: 
		1. Don't promote liberal or social democratic platforms, parties, or candidates. This applies to left-liberals and social democrats such as Sanders, AOC, Corbyn, etc, as well as bourgeois parties including the Democrats, UK Labour, the Australian Greens, among others. News regarding liberal politics may be posted in the event that it’s presented from a socialist perspective and isn’t obvious promotion or campaigning. More on the mod team's approach toward liberal content can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/athcp5/sub_announcement_american_electionmania/). If in doubt, feel free to [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/socialism).
	4. Debate/“Change My View” posts from non-socialist perspectives: 
		1. [r/Socialism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism) is a community for socialists and, therefore, posts along the lines of "Capitalism is effective, change my mind" aren't allowed. You can find a list of debate oriented subreddits on our sidebar.
	5. Reactionary Content: 
		1. Don't link to or platform fascist/reactionary sites even if it's to criticize or mock them. This includes, but is not limited to Breitbart, Fox News, Infowars, etc as well as reactionary subreddits, and the websites/social media of reactionary political figures, YouTube personalities, or provocateurs. If you feel that such content is of urgent importance or relevance, a screenshot or article from a different source covering the content in question is preferred.
	6. Shit Liberals Say: 
		1. This subreddit isn't a place to share screenshots of ridiculous things said by liberals. Please direct those posts to dedicated subreddits such as [r/ShitLiberalsSay](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitLiberalsSay), [r/ShitFascistsSay](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitFascistsSay) or [r/ShitSettlersSay](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitSettlersSay).
	7. Sectarianism: 
		1. [r/Socialism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism) is a multi-tendency subreddit and, as such, works within an obvious range of contradictions. There is a lot of room for healthy discussion with other socialists you disagree with ideologically. However, bad faith attacks on socialists of other tendencies are not encouraged. You're welcome to be critical of other tendencies and deconstruct opposing leftist ideologies, but hollow insults like 'armchair', 'tankie', 'anarkiddies', and so on without well-crafted arguments are not welcome. Any inter-leftist ideological discourse should be constructive and well-reasoned.
	8. Inter-sub drama:
		1. This is not the place for "I got banned from X sub for Y" or "X subreddit should do Y" posts. Please keep those to more appropriate subreddits.
	9. Excessive Self-promotion: 
		1. This is a community, not a platform for self-promotion. Excessive self-promotion to your blog, YouTube channel, podcast or subreddits, screenshots of your own twitter posts, etc. in addition to a lack of interaction with the subreddit, might result in removals or a ban.
	10. Off-topic content: 
		1. Do not post content which has nothing to do with socialism as a sociopolitical movement.
	11. Content violating the General Bans Policy: 
		1. Submissions violating one or more [rules](SocialismAndCommunism/Wiki/Rules.md) listed in our [General Bans Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/index/generalbans)(bigotry, police/prison apologia, trolling, etc) or Reddit's content policies (doxxing, incitement of violence, brigading) will be removed and may be subject to bans as specified according to the GBP.
