## Introduction

Most of us revolutionary activists are ‘practical’  
people. We feel, “Why bother about ideology, and  
theory, and such other things, ... that is for the  
scholars and ‘intellectuals’, ... the most important  
thing is to get on with the job”. The lower level  
activists and members feel that it is sufficient that the  
Central Committee and the higher committees do  
study and provide guidance; and often, many  
members in the higher committees also feel that other  
work is too pressing to‘allow’much time for theory.

On the other hand, there are a fewothers who feel it  
is necessary to know every work of the Great  
Teachers in order to work‘properly’. They spend a  
large amount of time intrying toread everything.  
They also have a tendency to treat everything they  
read as dogma.

It is necessaryto avoid boththese attitudes inour  
study. All comrades should give sufficient time and  
attention to study in order to understand the essence  
of our ideology — Marxism-Leninism-Maoism  
(MLM). Rather than knowing by heart a large number  
of books, it is necessary tounderstand deeply the  
essential and basic aspects of our guiding ideology. If  
we do this and learn to apply it in our day to day  
work we can greatly improve our practice, both, as  
individual activists, as well as, of the party as a whole.  
Very often we understand and analyse the world  
around us only according to our own limited 
experiences and therefore arrive at wrong conclusions.  
A proper understanding of MLM can help us  
overcome such errors. At other times a superficial  
understanding can lead to going by only the letter of  
certain party decisions and stands and not  
understanding their essence and spirit. Such mistakes  
can also be avoided by a deeper grasp of MLM. By our  
study of MLM, we learn from the positive and  
negative experiences of World Revolution; we learn to  
absorb the good in it, and we learn to differentiate  
between the good and the bad in our own practice. We  
thus learn to recognise, criticise, and fight all types of  
opportunism. In short, MLMis a must to mould our  
practice in the light of theory.

This Basic Course in MLMis intended to present to  
activists an understanding of the principal aspects of  
our ideology. Our ideology is, first and foremost, a  
‘practical’theory, meant to be implemented and put  
into practice. The theory itself emerged in the course  
of numerous class struggles. It is therefore essential to  
understand the concrete material conditions and social  
practice through which the Great Teachers of the  
proletariat–Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao–  
discovered and formulated its basic principles. Thus,  
this book has been presented by relating the historical  
process of the growth and development of MLM. The  
basic concepts have been presented in short by,  
wherever possible, linking to the socioeconomic  
conditions, mainpolitical events and class struggles  
that gave birth to them. In order to understand any

particular aspect in detail, more particular study  
would be necessary. This Basic Course however is  
meant to provide an essential basis for understanding  
the dynamic process of the development of our  
ideology and in what historical conditions and  
circumstances certain stands and theory came into  
being.

Come; let’s begin our study.

Chapter 2

What is MLM?

The party leading the revolution is the Communist  
party; and the ideology guiding the thinking and  
practice of the Communist party is Marxism-  
Leninism-Maoism. This is known to all of us.  
However many of us are not so sure as to what exactly  
is meant by communist ideology or MLMand what  
are its various parts or aspects. Quite a few understand  
it simply as the ideas of Marx, Lenin and Mao. Such  
an understanding is incomplete, insufficient and  
superficial. What is needed is to go deeper into the  
matter and understand the internal essence. Let us first  
therefore try to understand this essence of MLM.

At the time when Marx and Engels were first  
developing and propagating the theory of  
communism, Engels, in 1847, drafted a booklet called  
“The Principles of Communism”. In this he defined  
what is communism in the following very simple  
manner, “Communism is the doctrine of the  
prerequisites for the emancipation of the  
proletariat.” Thus Engels, in this very short  
definition explains that the essence of communist  
ideology is to provide the theory regarding what is  
needed to achieve the ultimate freedomof the working  
class (the proletariat). This freedomwould finally be  
achieved through the establishment of communist  
society.

Stalin explained the same thing in the following  
way, “Marxismis the science of the laws governing  
the development of nature and society, the science  
of the revolutionof the oppressed and exploited  
masses, the science of the victory of socialismin all  
countries, the science of building a communist  
society.” Here Stalin explains the wide scope of  
Marxism. Firstly, it is a science, which provides the  
answers to the questions concerning not only society,  
but also the whole of nature. Thus Marxismis an all-  
encompassing science. Secondly, it is a science  
regarding revolution; and this revolution is not of the  
rich (as in earlier bourgeois revolutions of the  
capitalist class), but of the poor and toiling masses.  
And thirdly it is the science of building socialist and  
communist society.

This science is today giventhe name of Marxism-  
Leninism-Maoism after the names of the three  
Teachers who played the greatest role in establishing  
and developing it–Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and  
Mao Tse-tung. Besides these three, we recognise two  
other great Teachers who played a tremendous role–  
Frederick Engels andJoseph Stalin. Engels was the  
comrade of Marx who closely collaborated with him  
in laying the foundations of Marxism, as well as in  
advancing it after Marx’s death. Stalin defended and  
developed Marxism-Leninismafter Lenin’s death.

Marxism was first worked out by Marx, with the help  
of Engels, more than150 years ago. The principal

parts of Marxismare: the philosophy of dialectical  
materialism and the discovery of the materialist  
conception of history or historical materialism;  
Marxist political economy which discovered the laws  
of motion of capitalismand its contradictions and the  
doctrine of surplus value which uncovered the source  
of exploitation; and the theory of scientific  
socialism based on the doctrine of the class struggle  
and the outlining of the principles governing the  
tactics of the class struggle of the proletariat.

Leninism is Marxismof the era of imperialismand  
the proletarian revolution. It was first developed by  
Lenin around the turn of the century during the  
course of the Russian revolution, while fighting the  
opportunismof the Second International, and while  
advancing the international communist movement  
through the Third International. Leninism, while  
defending and developing Marxism, made the  
following significant contributions: the discovery of  
the laws of motion of capitalismunder imperialism  
and howthey would inevitably lead the imperialist  
powers to war; the qualitative development of the  
theory and practice of proletarian revolution during  
the bourgeois democratic revolution as well as the  
socialist revolution; a clear understanding regarding  
the dictatorship of the proletariat, as well as the first  
principles regarding socialist construction; providing  
the theory and direction for the nationality  
movements and the movements inthe colonies and  
linking the national liberation movements to the

World Socialist Revolution; the development of the  
organisational principles of the Leninist party–the  
partyof the newtype. Stalin, while defending and  
developing Leninism, particularly contributed to the  
principles and laws governing the period of socialist  
construction.

Maoism is an extension and development of  
Marxism-Leninismapplicable to the present era. It  
was developed by Mao during the course of the  
Chinese Revolution, in the process of socialist  
construction, in the fight against modern revisionism  
and particularly during the Great Proletarian Cultural  
Revolution. Maoism’s contributions include: the  
theory of contradictions, the development of the  
theory of knowledge and the formulation of the mass  
line of‘fromthe masses, to the masses’; the theory of  
new democracy, the formulation of the path of  
revolution for the colonies and semi-colonies, and the  
formulation regarding the three magic weapons of the  
revolution–the party, people’s army and the united  
front; the theory of protracted people’s war and the  
development of the principles of military warfare; the  
development of the organisational principles of the  
proletarian party through the understanding of two-  
line struggle, rectification campaigns and criticismand  
self-criticism; the development of the political  
economy of socialismon the basis of the Soviet and  
Chinese experience and the dialectical understanding  
of the process of socialist construction as the correct  
handling of contradictions in the process of transition

tosocialism; and finally and most importantly, the  
theory and practice of continuing revolutionunder  
the dictatorship of the proletariat to consolidate  
socialism, combat modern revisionismand prevent the  
restoration of capitalism, and its concrete expression  
in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Marxism, Leninism, and Maoism are thus not  
separate ideologies, but represent the constant  
growth and advancement of one and the same  
ideology. We shall in the following pages try to trace  
the storyof the process of its development. While  
doing this we shall also try to understand the essence  
of its various parts and aspects that have been listed  
above. The list may appear to be long and difficult,  
but it need not be so. If we concentrate and try to  
understand the basic essence of each aspect within its  
historical context we will be able grasp a lot.

Chapter 3

Socio-economic Conditions Leading to The Birth  
of Marxism

As we will see later, Marxismteaches us that any ideas  
or theory are always the product of some material  
conditions. Whenever newmaterial conditions come  
into being, newideas and theories too are bound to  
emerge. This same truth applies also to Marxismitself.  
Thus in order to understand Marxism better we  
should try to knowthe material conditions, i.e. the  
socioeconomic conditions, within which Marx and  
Engels first gave birth to Marxism.

Marxismwas established over 150 years ago, during  
the 1840s. It was established first in Europe, which at  
that time dominated the whole world economically,  
politically and militarily. This world domination was  
such that almost all earlier advanced civilizations like  
India, China and Persia had been subordinated to it.  
Marx and Engels were born and lived in some of the  
most economicallyadvanced parts of Europe while  
developing the ideas of Marxism. They observed,  
participated in and were influenced by all the major  
political events of that time. Thus in order to  
understand howMarxismwas born we will first have  
to take a look at the Europe of that time and see the  
principal factors in the socioeconomic situation then.

1.  The most important factor was the Industrial  
    Revolution, which lasted approximately from1760 to

1830, and, though it was centred in England,  
influenced the whole world. The Industrial  
Revolution was named as such because it was during  
these seventy years that the world first saw an  
explosive and revolutionary upsurge in industrial  
development. It was at this time that modernlarge  
factories were first set up and grewat a very rapid  
pace, particularly in England. Along with this was the  
tremendous expansion of the worldmarket, which  
sent English manufactured goods to all parts of the  
world. Though other countries like France, Holland,  
and parts of Germany and the USAalso set up large  
factories, this period was heavily dominated by  
England. Its domination was such that it came to be  
calledthe ‘workshopof the world’ which supplied  
manufactured goods to all countries.

The Industrial Revolution transformed the capitalist  
class. This class was earlier economically not so strong  
and was a middle class (it was called the bourgeoisie  
because bourgeois in French means middle class). But,  
with the Industrial Revolution, this middle class was  
transformed into a class of industrial millionaires– the  
modern industrial bourgeoisie. The untold riches of  
this newclass gave it the strength to more powerfully  
challenge the feudal classes, which were, till then, still  
the ruling classes.

Alongside the modern industrial bourgeoisie the  
Industrial Revolution also gave birth to another class

-   the modern industrial working class, or

proletariat. This class consisting of workers working  
together in thousands in large factories was also far  
different fromthe earlier workers working insmall  
groups in tiny workshops. The modern proletarians  
possessed nothing else except their labouring power  
and had a strength and confidence not known to  
earlier generations of workers and toilers. This  
strength came from their contact with modern  
industry, their discipline learnt from the factory  
system, and their superior organisation due to their  
large numbers assembled together in single factories  
under one roof. Their position within society made  
them the potentially most revolutionary force in  
history.

2.  The other important factor was that which  
    dominated the political situationinEurope at that  
    time. It was the spate of bourgeois democratic  
    revolutions led by the rising capitalist class, of which  
    the most important was theFrench Revolution of

1789.  The French Revolution not only brought about  
    very radical changes in France. It also led to the  
    Napoleonic wars where the armies of the French  
    bourgeoisie conquered almost the whole of Europe  
    and introduced bourgeois reforms abolishing  
    feudalism wherever they went. They thus dealt a  
    deathblowto the kings and old feudal classes. Though  
    the French armies were later defeated, the old ruling  
    classes could never recover their old position. The  
    modern bourgeoisie continued its revolutionary wave  
    with numerous other bourgeois revolutions, which

resulted in the conclusive defeat of the feudal classes  
and the victory of capitalismas a world system.

Thus bothat the economic and political levels the  
period of the birth of Marxismwas a period of great  
advances and victories for the capitalist class when it  
was conclusively establishing its rule in the most  
advanced and dominant countries of the world.

3.  Though this was the period of the greatest  
    advancement of the bourgeoisie, the principal factor  
    that gave birth to Marxismduring this period was the  
    rise of working class consciousness and proletarian  
    organisations and movements thus signaling  
    the emergence of the proletariat as an independent  
    and self-conscious force.

This rise of a class-conscious proletariat first took  
place in England and France. This was primarily  
because of the early spreadof modernindustry in  
these two countries. The spread of modern industry,  
though it brought great wealth to the bourgeoisie, at  
the same time meant the most inhumane working and  
living conditions for the working class. Almost three-  
quarter of the workforce was composed of women and  
children because they provided cheaper and more  
easily controllable workers for the capitalists.  
Children fromthe age of six onwards were forced to  
work fourteen and sixteen hours in the spinning mills.  
As the bourgeoisie amassed greater and greater wealth  
the workers fell into greater and greater misery. While  
the cloth mill owners multiplied their capital many

times over, their weavers’wages reduced to one eighth  
of what they earlier obtained.

Thus the conditions of the proletariat were such that  
rebellion was not merely possible but almost  
compulsory. The first such outbursts were  
spontaneous, without clear direction. An example was  
the machine-breaking agitation of 1810-11 in  
England, where groups of weavers would attack the  
textile mills and smash whatever machinery they  
could lay their hands on. This was their method of  
protesting against the modern industry that was  
destroying their very livelihood. Such protests having  
no clear direction, and being severely repressed,  
quickly died out.

What followed was the spread and growth of the  
labour movement and labour organisations that  
provided the answer and direction to the fighting  
proletariat. Earlier unions, which had been restricted  
to skilled workers, started from 1818 uniting all  
labouring men together in what were then called  
‘general trades’unions. As these unions inEngland  
started growing, a movement to start a national level  
union started building up. This was formed, and by  
1833-34 reached a membership of 500,000. Along with  
the unions, workers also started organising themselves  
in cooperatives and mutual benefit societies. In other  
countries where unions were largely bannedthese  
were the main forms of organisations of the working  
class which also grew in numbers and strength.

As the workers organisations started growing, the  
workers in Britain launched the Chartist  
movement in 1837 demanding electoral rights for  
workers. This was the first broad, truly mass and  
politically organised proletarian revolutionary  
movement. It used the method of mass petitions to  
Parliament somewhat similar to the signature  
campaigns sometimes organised today. These petitions  
gathered upto 5 million signatures. Some of the  
Chartist demonstrations had 350,000 participants  
showing the organised strength of the working class.  
However as the movement grew in strength and  
militancy it faced severe repression and was suppressed  
by 1850. During the early1840s while Engels was  
staying inManchester (inEngland) he was inclose  
contact with revolutionary Chartist leaders as well as  
its weekly The Northern Star and was influenced by  
the Chartist movement.

The growing militancy of the workers movement also  
often in this period led to the first worker  
uprisings which were suppressed brutally. Examples  
of these were the uprisings inLondonin1816 and  
Manchester in 1819, the uprisings of the silk-workers  
of Lyons (France) in 1831 and 1834, and the uprising  
of the handloomlinen-weavers of Silesia in Prussian  
Germany (todaypart of Poland) in 1844. The last-  
named struggle had a strong impact throughout  
Germany as well as on the young Marx.

Thus, by the time of the 1840s, the proletarian

movement was growing rapidly in strength and  
intensity inmany industrial countries. However, it  
was still very weak and in no position to yet pose a  
threat to either the dominant big bourgeoisie or the  
old feudal ruling classes. Nevertheless the emergence  
of the proletariat as an independent class force was an  
event of world historical significance. The coming into  
material existence of the proletariat also meant at the  
same time the birth of the ideas representing this new  
revolutionary class. Many ideas and theories claiming  
torepresent working class interests thus came into  
being. Marxism, when it was first formulated in the  
1840s was only one among these. However, though  
many theories had emerged fromthe same economic  
conditions, Marxism alone provided the tools to  
properly understand these conditions and also to  
change them. Therefore in the years to come it was  
Marxism alone that would prove to be the true  
proletarian ideology.

Chapter 4

Early Life of Marx and Engels Until they became  
Marxists

Obviously nobody can be born a Marxist–not even  
Marx. There has to be a process through which ideas  
and views are developed and formulated and take a  
basic shape which can be called an ideology. Naturally  
Marx and Engels too had to go through such a process  
before they came to discover and themselves grasp the  
basic truths of what we today knowas Marxism. This  
process of thought was naturally determined to a great  
extent by the concrete experiences that both of them  
went through. In order therefore to understand this in  
some depth let us briefly look at the early life  
experiences of these two great teachers.

Karl Marx was born on 5th of May 1818, in the town  
of Trier, in what was then called Rhenish Prussia, and  
which is today part of Germany. His father, Heinrich  
Marx, was one of the top lawyers of the town. The  
family was well to do and cultured, but not  
revolutionary. Both Marx’parents came froma long  
line of Jewish priests. Thus, though they were  
economically well off, they had to face social  
discrimination in the anti-Jewatmosphere of Prussia.  
In 1816, Marx’ father was forced to convert to  
Christianity because the Prussian government had  
then brought out a rule stopping Jews frompracticing  
law. Similarly, in 1824, another Prussian law was  
passed to prevent non-Christians frombeing admitted

to public schools. To overcome this, again Heinrich  
Marx was forced to baptize his son Karl, along with all  
his brothers and sisters. Thus, though he was no  
believer in organised religion, Marx’father was forced  
to adopt a new faith just in order to pursue his  
profession and give his children a good education.

Marx’ hometown, Trier, is the oldest town in  
Germany, which for many centuries hadbeen the  
residence of Romanemperors and later the seat of  
Catholic bishops, with a religious administration for  
the town and surrounding area. In August 1794 the  
French armies capturedthe town, instituted a civil  
administration, and brought in the ideas and  
institutions of the French Revolution. The town only  
went back into the hands of the Prussian king after  
the defeat of France’s Napoleon in 1815. Thus during  
the time of Marx’birth and youth it still carried the  
definite impact of twenty-one years of French  
revolutionary ideas.

Trier was a small town, similar in size to our smaller  
taluka towns, with a population then of around  
12,000. It was principally a market town for the  
surrounding area, which for centuries has been a  
famous wine-growing area. Its population was  
composed of occupations typical to a‘service’town–  
civil servants, priests, small merchants, craftsmen, etc.  
It had remained untouched by the Industrial  
Revolution and was thus economically relatively  
backward. During Marx’ youthit also had a high

degree of poverty. Official statistics in 1830 gave an  
unemployment figure of one in every four, though the  
actual figure must have been much higher. Beggars and  
prostitutes were common and the figures of petty  
crime like stealing was extremely high. Thus Marx  
froma very young age was witness to the misery of  
the poorer labouring classes.

After attending elementary school, Marx entered the  
Friedrich WilhelmGymnasium(secondary school) in  
1831, fromwhich he passed out in 1835. Within three  
weeks he was sent for further studies at the law faculty  
of theuniversity forty miles away fromTrier, at the  
city of Bonn (an important centre which is today the  
joint capital of Germany). Marx, with a desire to learn  
as much as much as possible, immediately registered in  
nine courses that besides law, included poetry,  
literature, art, etc. He was at first regular at lectures  
but gradually lost interest, particularly in the law  
lectures, which he found dry andunsatisfying. He  
reduced his courses first to six and then to four.

He decided to study on his own and soon got involved  
in the stormy life of the students of whomhe soon  
became a leader. Being deeply interested inwriting  
poetry he also joined the Poetenbund, a circle of  
young writers founded by revolutionary students. In  
the constant struggle between the sons of the feudal  
nobles and the bourgeoisie, he soon became a leader of  
the bourgeois group. He was often involved in  
fistfights and sometimes in sword-duels. He carried a

stiletto knife (somewhat similar to our gupti knives),  
for which he was once arrested and had a police case  
put on him. He was also sentenced to one day in the  
university’s student prison on charges of “nightly  
uproarious disturbances of the peace and  
drunkenness”. Marx, in one sword-duel was even  
injured on his right eyebrow. This led to his father  
withdrawing him from the Bonn University and  
bringing himback to Trier in August 1836.

While he was inTrier he got secretly engaged to  
Jenny von Westphalen, the daughter of Baron von  
Westphalen a nobleman and senior Prussian  
government official. Jenny, who was four years elder  
to him, andMarx, were childhoodloves who had  
decided to get married while Marx was still in school.  
They nowgot engaged with the approval of Marx’  
parents, but without Jenny’s parents approval, which  
was only obtained in 1837.

In October 1836 Marx moved to the University of  
Berlin, which was the capital of Prussia. The  
university was much larger than Bonn and was  
renowned as a major centre of learning. After  
registering for his University courses, Marx  
immediately jumped into a stormof work. He stayed  
up night after night, eating irregularly, smoking  
heavily, reading heavy books and filling up notebooks.  
Instead of formal classes Marx pursued his studies on  
his own. Working at a tremendous pace he moved  
fromlawto philosophy to poetry to art and then to

writing plays and stories and then back to philosophy  
and poetry. His overwork hada bad effect of his  
health, particularly his tobacco affected lungs, and he  
sometimes was forced totake a break. But he was  
always back to his excessive work habits, reading up  
everything, fromthe ancient to the latest works of  
scientists and philosophers. His bent was towards  
philosophy, always trying to find universal meaning;  
always searching for the absolute in principles,  
definitions and concepts.

During his second year at the University he joined a  
group of philosophy students and teachers  
called Young Hegelians. They were followers of the  
famous Germanphilosopher, FrederickHegel, who  
had taught at Berlin University and died in 1830. They  
tried to give a radical interpretation to Hegel’s  
philosophy and for this were sometimes called Left  
Hegelians. One of Marx’friends in this group, its  
intellectual leader, was a professor called Bruno Bauer  
who was a militant atheist who constantly attacked  
the church’s teachings. Such attacks, along with the  
radical political views of the Young Hegelians, made  
thema target of the Prussian authorities. Thus when  
Marx completed his doctoral thesis he could not  
obtain his degree fromthe Berlin University, which  
was dominated by reactionary appointees of the  
Prussian government. After completing his studies in  
Berlin, he submitted his thesis and obtained his Ph.D.  
in April 1841 fromthe liberal leaning University of  
Jena that was outside Prussian control.

After obtaining his degree he had hoped to become a  
lecturer at the Bonn University where Bruno Bauer  
had shifted to in 1839. But Bauer himself was in  
trouble because of the student disturbances his anti-  
religion lectures were causing. Finally the King  
himself ordered the removal of Bauer fromthe Bonn  
University. This meant the end to Bauer’s teaching  
career as well as any hope of a teaching job for Marx.

Marx started concentrating on journalism, which he  
had already started immediately after leaving  
University. This also helped himto participate more  
thoroughly in the rapidly growing radical  
democratic opposition movementthen developing in  
his Rhineland province and the neighbouring province  
of Westphalia. These provinces which had experienced  
the liberating influence of the French anti- feudal  
reforms were major centres of opposition to the  
Prussianking. Industrialisation hadalsoled to the  
growth of the bourgeoisie, particularlyin Cologne,  
the richest city of the Rhineland. This meant strong  
support for this radical opposition movement by the  
industrialists, who were fed up with the excessive  
controls of the feudals.

Marx first started writing for, and then, in October  
1842, became the chief editor of The Rheinische  
Zeitung, a daily newspaper supported by such  
industrialists. In Marx’ hands the newspaper soon  
became a fighter for radical democratic rights. This  
however brought Marx into constant conflict with the

Prussiancensors whowere very repressive. Finally,  
when the paper published a criticismof the Russian  
Czar’s despotism, the Czar himself brought pressure  
on the Prussian King to take action. The paper was  
banned and had to be closed down in March 1843.  
Marx then started involving himself in a plan to bring  
out a new journal The German-French Yearbooks.

During this period, from1841 to 1843, Marx was  
deeply involved in the stormy political life of that  
period. However he was basically a radical  
democrat and did not at that time hold communist  
views. At the level of philosophy his major  
transformation during this period was in 1841 after  
reading a book The Essence of Christianity by Ludwig  
Feuerbach which presented a criticism of religion  
fromthe standpoint of materialism. This book played  
a major role in shifting Marx’ideas fromthe idealism  
of the Young Hegelian group to materialism. Another  
philosophical work of 1841 (The European  
Triarchy) that influenced Marx was the attempt by his  
friend, Moses Hess, to develop a communist  
philosophyby combining French socialist and Left  
Hegelian ideas.

However at that time Marx yet had only a limited  
knowledge of the ideas of the socialists and  
communists. His first contact was in 1842 when he  
read with interest the works of many of the leading  
French socialist theorists. He was however not  
converted to communism or socialism by these

readings. This change came about more through  
his contact with working class communist groups  
and study of political economy, both of which took  
place mainly after moving to Paris at the end of

Seven years after their engagement, Marx and Jenny  
were married in June 1843. They had a short  
honeymoon in Switzerland during which Marx wrote  
a booklet where he presented his initial criticisms of  
Hegel. After the honeymoon he started the study and  
preparations for moving to Paris from where the  
earlier mentioned German-French Yearbooks was to  
be brought out. This move to Paris was planned in  
order to avoid the Prussian censors. However, though  
the journal was plannedas a monthly, it collapsed  
after only one issue that came out in February 1844.

Marx’period in Paris was however marked by very  
significant new experiences. Of the greatest  
importance was direct contact with the various  
socialist and communist groups of which Paris was a  
hot centre. Besides meeting a large number of  
theoreticians and revolutionaries Marx benefited  
greatly by regular contact with the many working  
class revolutionaries in Paris. At the same time Marx  
started a study of political economy in which he read  
most of the works of the famous English economists.  
The revolutionary contacts and further study had  
their impact. These were reflected in Marx’writings.

The only issue of the Yearbooks was of crucial

importance because it contained Marx’ first broad  
generalisation of a Marxist materialist  
understanding of history that was contained in an  
article criticising Hegel’s philosophy. It was in this  
article that Marx made the highly important  
formulation regarding the historical role of the  
proletariat. He also here made his famous formulation  
that religionis the opiumof the people. The same  
issue also contained an article by Engels on political  
economy, which also gave a materialist  
understanding regarding the development of  
modern capitalism.

It was Marx’ interest in Engels’ writings that led to  
their meeting in Paris between August 28 and  
September 6 1844.This turned out to be a historic  
meeting that helped the two great thinkers to  
clarify their ideas and lay the first foundations of  
Marxism. Though they had both independently  
come to similar conclusions earlier, this meeting  
helped them to achieve complete theoretical  
agreement. It was at this meeting that they more  
clearly came to an understanding regarding the  
materialist conception of history, whichwas the  
cornerstone of Marxist theory.

Frederick Engels was born on 28th November 1820  
in the textile town of Barmen in the Rhine province of  
Prussia. His father was the wealthy owner of a cotton-  
spinning mill and was a fiercely religious Protestant  
Christian with a reactionary political outlook.

Barmen, like Marx’Trier, also belonged to the part of  
Prussia which had seen twenty years of French  
conquest. It thus also had progressive influences on it.  
However its main characteristic was that it was one of  
the biggest Rhenish industrial centres. Thus Engels  
froma very early age saw the severe poverty and  
exploitation of the working class. To survive against  
factorycompetitioncraftsmenwere forced towork  
frommorning to night. Oftenthey tried to drown  
their sorrows in drink. Child labour and occupational  
lung diseases were rampant.

Engels attended the Barmen town school till the age of

14.  He was then sent to the gymnasium at the  
    neighbouring town of Elberfeld (today both Barmen  
    and Elberfeld are merged into one town).  
    This gymnasium (secondary school) had the  
    reputation of being one of the best in Prussia. He was  
    an intelligent student with an early flair for learning  
    languages. He was also part of a poetry circle among  
    the students and wrote his own poetry andshort  
    stories. He was planning to study economy and law  
    but his father was more interested in making his eldest  
    son learn the family business. At the age of 17 he was  
    suddenly removed fromschool and made to join as an  
    apprentice in his father’s office.

Though this was the end of Engels’formal schooling  
he continued to use his free time to study history,  
philosophy, literature and linguistics and to write  
poetry, which he was attracted to. The next year, in

July 1838, Engels was sent to work as a clerk in a  
large trading firmin the large port city of Bremen.  
The big city atmosphere brought Engels incontact  
with foreignliterature and the press. Inleisure he  
started reading fiction and political books. He  
continued learning newlanguages and besides German  
got some knowledge of Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanish,  
Portuguese, French, English, Dutch, etc. This ability  
to learn languages continued throughout Engels’life  
during which he learnt to be quite fluent in over 20  
languages including Persian and Arabic. Also in  
Bremen, Engels became a good horseman, swimmer,  
swordsman and skater.

While at school itself Engels had been a fighter against  
bureaucracy. Nowas a grown youth he was attracted  
to the radical democratic ideas of the bourgeois  
democratic revolution then taking shape in Germany.  
The first group he was attracted towards was  
the Young Germany literary group that stood for  
radical political views. He soon started writing for a  
journal being brought out by themfromthe port city  
of Hamburg, not far fromBremen. He wrote two  
articles on the situation in his home district. He  
exposed the severe exploitation of the workers in  
Barmen and Elberfeld, the diseases suffered by them,  
and the fact that half the children of the town were  
deprived of school and forced to work in the factories.  
He particularly attacked the hollowness of the  
religiosity of the exploitative industrialists (which  
included his own father).

Towards the end of 1839 he started a study of Hegel,  
whose philosophy he tried to link with his own  
radical democratic beliefs. However he only made  
further progress in this when he finished his clerkship  
in Bremen in1841, and, after a few months gap,  
moved to Berlin for one year’s compulsory military  
service.

While in military service he joined  
the Berlin University as an external student and did a  
course in philosophy. He then became closely  
connected with the Young Hegelian group which  
Marx had been part of. He, like Marx, was also  
influenced greatly by the materialist views in  
Feurbach’s book that came out in that year. Engels’  
writings nowstarted to have some materialist aspects.  
The main thing he always stressed was political action.  
This was what made him split, in 1842, from his  
earlier Young German group, which he felt restricted  
itself only to empty literary debate. He however  
continued to strongly be linked with the Young  
Hegelians, particularly Bruno Bauer and his brother.

It was this closeness of Engels with the Bauers that  
prevented a friendship with Marx, when they met for  
the first time in November 1842. Engels at that time  
had finished his military service and was on his way  
fromhis hometown to join as a clerk in his father’s  
business in Manchester, in England. On the way he  
visited Marx at the newspaper office in Cologne  
where Marx was then the chief editor. Marx, by then,

had however started criticising Young Hegelians, and  
particularly the Bauers, for concentrating their  
propaganda too much on religion rather than politics.  
Hence Marx and Engels, having different political  
affiliations, could not come close at this, their first  
meeting.

It was Engels’ experiences in England that made  
him a communist. He developed very close links  
with the workers of Manchester, as well as the  
leaders of the revolutionary workers Chartist  
movement. Manchester was the main centre of the  
world’s modern textile industry and soon Engels  
undertook an in-depth study of the working and  
living conditions of its workers. He would regularly  
visit the working class areas to gain direct knowledge.  
In this process a love grewbetween himand Mary  
Burns, young Irish factory worker, who would  
later become his companion and wife. Besides  
collecting material for his future book on the  
conditions of the working class inEngland, Engels  
came to understand the revolutionary potential of the  
proletariat. His regular participation in the movement  
convinced himthat the working class was not merely  
a suffering class, but a fighting class whose  
revolutionary actions would build the future.

Besides working class contact, Engels also made a deep  
study of the various socialist and communist  
theories and even met many of the French and  
German leaders and writers who had formulated these

theories. Though he did not adopt any of these  
theories, he made an analysis of their positive and  
negative points. At the same time he started a deep  
study of bourgeois political economy. This was in  
order to help himanalyse the economic relations of  
society, which he had started feeling was the basis of  
all social change. The initial results of his study he put  
down in his article that was published by Marx in his  
journal brought out from Paris. As we have  
mentioned earlier, this led to correspondence between  
Marx and Engels and their historic meeting in 1844.

Engels was then on his way back fromManchester to  
his hometown Barmen, when he stopped on the way  
to meet Marx who was then staying in Paris. Their  
discussions helped Marx to better formulate the  
materialist understanding of history which they had  
both started believing in. They also, at this meeting,  
started work on their first joint book, which was an  
attack on Bruno Bauer and the Young Hegelian group,  
which they had both earlier belonged to.

Engels spent the next eight months doing intensive  
communist propaganda and organisational work in  
Germany. During this period he was in constant  
revolt against his father who opposed his communist  
workand tried toget him towork inhis factory.  
After just two weeks at his father’s office Engels  
rejected it completely and left Barmen to join Marx.  
Marx bythat time had againbecome the target of  
feudal authorities. The Prussian King hadbrought

pressure on the French King, who expelled Marx from  
Paris. Marx was forced to move to Brussels in Belgium  
along with his wife and eight-month-old child. This is  
where Engels came and set uphouse right next to  
Marx’s house.

Marx in the meantime had done deep work and  
had developed the main features of the newworld  
outlook, which they had discussed at their earlier  
meeting. In Brussels bothMarx andEngels started  
intensive joint work. This was, as Engels said, to  
develop the new outlookinall possible directions.  
The result was the historic book, The German  
Ideology, which however only got published almost a  
hundred years later. The main purpose served this  
book servedat that time was for the two great  
thinkers to self – clarify regarding their old  
understanding and set up the pillars of the new  
world outlook, which later came to be known as  
Marxism. Marx and Engels had become Marxists!

Chapter 5

The Three Sources of Marxism

Fromthe earlier account of the early life of Marx and  
Engels it is clear that they were both very  
extraordinary and brilliant men. However, it is also  
very clear that Marxismwas not some invention that  
suddenly emerged from the thoughts of these  
magnificent brains. The socioeconomic changes of  
that time provided the basis for the emergence of  
the true proletarian ideology. The actual content  
and the formof that ideology, however, were the  
product of the struggles waged in the most  
important fields of thought of that time. Marx and  
Engels being deep intellectuals had a wide and deep  
grasp of the latest advancement of thought in the most  
advanced countries of the period. They, thus, could  
stand onthe shoulders of the great thinkers before  
them, absorbing whatever was good, and rejecting  
what was wrong in them. And it was thus that they  
built the structure and content of Marxism.

Let us see which were the main fields of thoughts on  
which they based their ideas. Thus therefore we can  
also understand the main sources of Marxism.

1.  The first source of Marxist thought was German  
    Classical Philosophy. Any ideology has to have its  
    grounding insome philosophyand both Marx and  
    Engels, as we have seen, had a strong base in German  
    classical philosophy.

German philosophy had, during the period 1760 to  
1830, grown to become the most influential school in  
European philosophy. It had its base in the German  
middle classes. This class was intellectually very  
advanced but had not developed the political strength  
to make revolution, or the economic resources to  
make an Industrial Revolution. This was what  
probably inclined themtowards elaborate systems of  
thought.

However, this class, having many civil servants, had  
many contradictory aspects. It sometimes leant to the  
industrial bourgeoisie and proletariat on the one side  
and sometimes to the feudal classes on the other. This  
was thus reflected in German philosophy having both  
a progressive as well as an anti-progressive aspect. This  
was particularly seen in Hegel’s philosophy upon  
which Marx and Engels largely based  
themselves. They therefore rejected all the anti-  
progressive aspects that upheld the existing feudal  
society, and developed upon the progressive and  
revolutionary parts, to lay the foundations of  
Marxist philosophy.

2.  English Political Economy was the second  
    important source of Marxism. England being the  
    centre of the Industrial Revolution it was but natural  
    that the study of the economy and its laws should  
    reach its peak in this country. It was a newfield of  
    study, which basically started with the growth of  
    modern capitalism. It had its firmbasis in the modern

industrial bourgeoisie and played the role of justifying  
and glorifying capitalism. It also provided the  
intellectual arguments for the rising bourgeoisie in its  
struggles with the feudals.

In England its period started with the publication in  
1776 of the world famous book The Wealth of  
Nations, by AdamSmith. He basically argued that if  
capitalismwere given the fullest freedomto growit  
would lead to the greatest progress of humanity. He  
thus provided the argument for the reduction of  
controls of any sort by the feudals on the capitalist  
class. David Ricardo was another famous classical  
economist who played a crucial role in the battles of  
the bourgeoisie with the landlords. He was the one  
who pointed out that as capitalism progressed the  
average rate of profit of the capitalists fell. His very  
significant discovery was the development of the  
labour theory of value, which showed that all  
economic value is created by labour. Other later  
economists analysed the causes of economic crises  
under capitalism.

English political economy basically served the  
interests of the industrial bourgeoisie. It therefore  
played a revolutionary role against the feudal classes.  
However the economists very often didnot carry  
forward their analysis beyond the point where it hurt  
bourgeois class interests. Thus, for example, Ricardo,  
though he developed the labour theory of value, did  
not expose the exploitation of labour by the capitalist

class. This was done by Marx. He took ahead the  
work of the English economists beyond the limits  
of the capitalist class and drew the necessary  
revolutionary conclusions fromthem. It was thus  
that Marx developed the principles of Marxist  
political economy.

3.  The third source of Marxism was the  
    various socialist theories, which mainly originated  
    fromFrance. These theories represented the hopes  
    and aims of the newly emerging proletariat class. They  
    were both a reflection of, as well as a protest against  
    capitalist exploitation and oppression of the working  
    class. France at that time was the maincentre for  
    revolutionary groups and revolutionary theory, which  
    inspired the whole of Europe. It was therefore natural  
    that socialist theories too mainly came out of France.

Most of these theories had major defects, as they were  
not based ona proper scientific analysis of society.  
Nevertheless, they represented a break with the  
individualism, self-interest and competition of  
bourgeois revolutionary theory. They also pointed the  
way forward for the proletariat fromcapitalist society.  
Marx thus made a study of these theories of socialism  
and communism before formulating the Marxist  
principles of scientific socialism. While inParis, he  
spent a considerable amount of time with the leaders  
and members of the numerous French revolutionary  
and socialist groups. Marx took what was best in  
socialism and gave it the scientific basis of the

doctrine of class struggle. He thus developed the  
principles of Marxist scientific socialism.

This then is the story of howMarxismemerged from  
the three great sources of ideas in the then most  
advanced countries of the world. The three Sources  
of Marxism– German philosophy, English political  
economy and French socialist theories –  
corresponded to the three main component parts of  
the new ideology – Marxist philosophy of  
dialectical materialism, Marxist political economy  
and Marxist theory of scientific socialism. In the  
following pages we will try to understand the essence  
of each of these parts.

Chapter 6

The Basic Formulations of Marxist Philosophy :  
Dialectical and Historical Materialism

As we have repeatedly seen earlier, Marx and Engels  
always insisted that all philosophy should be  
practical and linked to the real world. This was  
expressed in the most clear manner by Marx in his  
famous saying, “The philosophers have always  
interpreted the world in various ways; the point,  
however, is to change it.”By this, Marx meant that he  
did not want to become a philosopher like our rishis  
and munnis sitting on some mountain and meditating  
regarding supernatural things. He did not see much  
point in thinking andcontemplation unless it was  
linked to the practical world. His basic search was to  
try to understand howthe world was changing and  
thus to participate in actual practice and change  
today’s world and society. He thus was interested in a  
philosophy that would be applied in social practice.

In order to do this Marx had to take a stand with  
regards to the basic division in all philosophy– the  
division between idealism and materialism. This  
division is regarding the basic question as to, which is  
primary–spirit or nature. Those who take the stand  
that spirit is primary belong to the camp of idealism,  
whereas those who take the stand that nature is  
primary belong to the camp of materialism. Idealism  
is always connected in one way or other to  
religion. Being men of practice, who were

absolutely opposed to religious beliefs, it was but  
natural that Marx and Engels established Marxist  
philosophy firmly in the camp of materialism.

In doing so they were definitely influenced and aided  
by the writings of Feuerbachandother materialist  
philosophers of that time. However these  
philosophers were mechanical materialists who  
understood nature and society to be like a machine  
turning round and round without any development or  
real change. Marx rejected mechanical materialism  
because it did not give any understanding of  
historical change and development.

For this Marx had to turn to dialectics, which is the  
science of the general laws of motion. The essence  
of dialectics is that it understands things in their  
inter-connections and contradictions. Dialectics thus  
was able to provide the science of development that  
Marx knew was necessary to change the world.

At that time Hegel’s philosophy and laws of dialectics  
(which Marx studied deeply) were the most advanced  
in Europe. But Hegel had developed his philosophical  
laws in an idealist way by only making them  
applicable to the field of thought. He belonged to the  
camp of idealismand refused to recognise that nature  
and material social being are primary, and spirit and  
ideas are secondary. He thus did not accept that his  
system of thought itself was a product of the  
development of human society to a definite stage. He  
refused to understand that his laws of thought were

themselves reflections of the laws of nature and  
society. Thus, as Marx said, Hegel’s dialectics, by  
being idealist, was standing on its head–that means it  
was absurd and illogical. Marx turned Hegel’s  
dialectics the right side up–that means he made it  
rational – by putting it on the basis of  
materialism. Marx took Hegel’s dialectical laws and  
gave themthe approach of materialist philosophy.  
He thus made Hegel’s laws of thought also into  
laws of nature and society. He thus formulated  
Dialectical Materialism, which is the essence of  
Marxist philosophy.

By giving dialectics a rational and materialist basis  
Marx changed it into a philosophy of revolution.  
Marx and Engels applied dialectical materialismto the  
study of society and history and thus discovered the  
materialist conception of history. The materialist  
conception of history was a new and revolutionary  
way of understanding society and social change. It  
explained the basis of social changes and political  
revolutions not as an invention of some brilliant  
men’s brains but as the product of the processes  
within society. It showed all revolutionaries that the  
path to social change lay in understanding society and  
accordingly formulating the ideas to bring about  
change.

The starting point of the materialist conceptionof  
history is the level of development of the material  
productive forces i.e. tools, machinery, skills,

etc. Marx says that according to the stage in the  
development of the productive forces we get  
definite relations of production i.e. relations of  
ownership and control over the means of  
production.Thus, for example, backward productive  
forces like the wooden plough, and wind, hand and  
animal operated mills give us feudal relations; modern  
productive forces like tractors, harvesters, etc., when  
they are widespread, give rise to capitalist relations of  
production. These relations of production constitute  
the economic structure of society, or the economic  
base of society.

On top of the economic base of society arises a  
legal and political superstructure with definite  
forms of social consciousness. Further, Marx says  
that it is the mode of production (consisting of the  
productive forces and relations of production) that  
conditions the social, political and intellectual life  
in general. Thus, for example, the feudal mode of  
production gives rise to very severe oppression on  
women and lower castes and a very undemocratic  
political system; the capitalist mode of production, on  
the other hand, reduces social oppression and brings  
some bourgeois democratic rights.

At a certain stage in the development of the  
productive forces theycome into conflict with the  
existing relations of production. These old relations of  
production start preventing the development of the  
productive forces. Unless these productionrelations

are changed the productive forces cannot  
develop. This period when the relations of  
production start acting as chains on the  
development of the productive forces is the  
beginning of the epoch of social revolution.  
Revolution is needed to change the relations of  
production i.e. the relation between the various  
classes in society. Once this happens and the  
relations of production or property relations are  
broken i.e. the economic base is changed, then the  
change in the whole superstructure follows quite  
quickly.

This materialist conceptionof history was the first  
great discovery of Marx, whichhe accomplished in  
1844-45. It was the foundationon whichthe other  
great pillars of Marxist theory were built.

In later years Marx and Engels, and the other Marxist  
Teachers further developed Marxist philosophy.  
However its essence remained the basic principles of  
dialectical and historical materialism mentioned  
above.

Chapter 7

Struggle Against Utopian Socialism and the  
Establishment of Scientific Socialism

Utopian socialism is the termused to describe the  
main trends of pre-Marxist socialism, which arose  
and became prominent in the first half of the  
nineteenth century. The terms ‘utopians’(derived  
fromthe idea of Utopia, which is supposed to be a  
state of things where everything is perfect) and  
‘socialist’ became popular first in the 1830s. They  
were used to describe a group of thinkers who  
developed theories to transformsociety on a more  
egalitarian basis by removing the individualism,  
selfishness and competitiveness in human  
nature. Many of these thinkers or their followers tried  
to implement their theories by setting up ideal  
communities where all the members worked, lived  
and shared the fruits of their labour on a cooperative  
basis. They believed that such ideal communities  
would provide the example that would then be  
followed by the rest of society. They thus did not rely  
on the actual processes in society for building their  
schemes of socialism. Rather theythought that the  
rationality of their plans and ideas itself was sufficient  
to convince people and change society.

Utopian socialismwas first and foremost a reaction to  
the oppression and exploitation of the working class  
under capitalism. The working people had fought  
bitterly for the overthrowof feudalism. However the

bourgeoisie’s slogans of freedom, equality and  
fraternity had only meant freedomfor the capitalist  
class and intensified exploitation of the workers. The  
various socialist doctrines arose as a result of the  
emerging class contradictions between the  
capitalists and workers and as a protest against  
exploitation. They attempted to build a systemthat  
would provide justice to the toilers.

The anarchy of capitalist production was another  
cause for the new socialist theories. The utopian  
socialists attempted to build rational systems that  
would provide for the needs of humankind in an  
orderly and harmonious fashion. Some of themeven  
tried to convince capitalists and government officials  
that their socialist systems where much more rational,  
planned, and therefore desirable than the existing  
capitalist system. They even thus attempted to get  
funds fromthe rich for their projects.

The main defect of pre-Marxist socialist doctrines  
was that they did not have a real basis in the class  
contradictions and class struggles unfolding in  
society. Though their ideas were themselves the  
product of the class contradictions within society, the  
utopian socialists did not realise that it was absolutely  
necessary to wage the class struggle in order to achieve  
socialism. Though their ideas were in reality a  
reflection of the aspirations of the infant  
proletariat, the utopian socialists did not recognise  
the central importance of the revolutionary role of

the proletariat in bringing about socialism.

When Marx and Engels came into contact with the  
socialist and communist groups they started trying to  
convince the followers of the utopian socialist theories  
of the incorrectness of their ideas. They participated  
intensively in the debates in the various revolutionary  
andworking class groups where these theories and  
ideas were being discussed. Their main aimwas to give  
a scientific basis to socialist theory. For this they had  
to expose the defects and wrong understanding of the  
earlier socialists and place socialismon the sound basis  
of the Marxist theory of class struggle.

As Marx himself pointed out the theory of class  
struggle was not something newinvented by him. In  
fact the earlier socialists and even bourgeois writers  
were quite conscious about and wrote about classes  
and class struggle. However the essential difference  
of the Marxist theory of class struggle is that it  
showed howthe class struggle led inevitably to  
socialismand communism.

Marx first of all showed that classes are not something  
that have always existed in human society. He showed  
that there was a long period in human history when  
there were no classes at all (i.e. during primitive  
communism). There would alsobe a period in the  
future when there would again be no  
classes. Secondly Marx particularly analysed the  
present day class struggle between the bourgeoisie and  
the proletariat and showed how this class struggle

would inevitably lead to revolutionby the workers  
and the establishment of the dictatorship of the  
proletariat i.e. socialism. Thirdly, Marx pointed out  
that this dictatorshipof the proletariat was itself a  
period of transition to a newsociety. The proletariat  
could only develop by destroying itself as a class, by  
abolishing all classes and establishing a classless society  
i.e. communism.

It is this theory of class struggle that Marx and Engels  
developed, propagated and brought into practice  
throughout their lives. It is this Marxist theory of  
class struggle that converted socialism into a  
science, which laid the basis of scientific socialism.  
With this, socialismwas no longer to be seen as the  
product of some brilliant mind, but it became the  
necessary outcome of the struggle between two  
historically developed classes – the proletariat and  
the bourgeoisie. Because of scientific socialism the  
task of the socialists did not become one of trying to  
develop the most perfect, harmonious and rational  
systemof society like the utopian socialists had tried  
to do. Under scientific socialism the task was to  
analyse society, to analyse the history and economic  
basis of the class contradictions in society, and from  
this economic basis to find the way to end all class  
conflict and bring socialismand communism.

The scientific clarity of Marxist socialist theory was so  
great that most sincere elements in the various  
socialist andcommunist organisations of the 1840s

soon rejected the pre-Marxist and non-class varieties of  
socialism. Marx and Engels soon became ideological  
leaders within the socialist movement. When a new  
international organisation was formed in 1847 uniting  
workers, intellectuals and revolutionary socialist  
groups of various countries they at once became its  
leaders. They suggested its name, The Communist  
League, and it was they who were appointed to draft  
its programme. This programme is the world  
historic Communist Manifesto.

The Communist Manifesto was not only the first  
programme and general line of the international  
proletariat. It also laid down the basic principles of  
scientific socialismand the approach to all other  
types of socialism. Withits quicktranslation into  
numerous languages, the Manifesto soonspread the  
basic ideas of Marxist scientific socialismthroughout  
Europe andthen throughout the world. The basic  
principles outlined in this document have in  
essence remained firm for more than 150 years,  
upto this day.

Chapter 8

Marxist Political Economy

As we have seen earlier Marx developed his principles  
of political economy in continuation of and in  
opposition to the bourgeois political economy of the  
English economists. Most of Marx’earlier economic  
writings from1844 to 1859 were inthe form of a  
critique of bourgeois political economy. He countered  
the claims of the bourgeois political economists that  
capitalismwas a permanent and universal system. On  
the other hand he proved that capitalismcould exist  
only for a limited period and was destined to be  
overthrown and replaced by a newand higher social  
system. His later economic analysis, particularly the  
various volumes of his main work, Capital,  
concentrated on discovering the economic laws of  
capitalism. The in-depth analysis of the relations of  
production in capitalist society, in their origin,  
development and decline, thus forms the main  
content of Marx’ political economy.

Bourgeois political economists always made their  
analysis in the formof a relation between things i.e.  
the exchange of one commodity for another. Marx  
however showed that economics deals not with  
things but with relations between persons, and in  
the last resort between classes.

Since under capitalism it is the production of  
commodities that dominates, Marx started his

analysis with an analysis of the commodity. He  
pointed out that the exchange of commodities was  
not a mere exchange of things but actually an  
expression of the relation between individual  
producers in society who have been linked by the  
market. Though commodity exchange has existed for  
thousands of years, it is only with the development of  
money and the birth of capitalismthat it reaches its  
peak linking up the entire economic life of millions of  
individual producers throughout society into one  
whole. Capitalismeven converts the labour power of  
the worker into a commodity that is bought and sold  
freely in the market place.

The wageworker sells his labour power to the owner  
of the means of production, i.e. the capitalist. The  
worker spends one part of his working day producing  
the equivalent of his wage, i.e. producing what is  
necessary to cover the cost of maintaining himself and  
his family. The other part of his working day is spent  
producing for the maintenance and growth of the  
capitalist. The worker gets absolutely no payment  
fromthis production which is for the capitalist. This  
additional value which every worker produces, over  
and above the value necessary to earn his wage and  
maintain himself, Marx called surplus value. It is  
the source of profit and the source of wealth of the  
capitalist class.

The discovery of the concept of surplus value  
exposed the nature of exploitation of the working

class. It also brought out the source of the  
antagonism between the proletariat and the  
bourgeoisie. This class antagonism was the  
principal manifestation of the fundamental  
contradiction of capitalist society: the contradiction  
between the social character of production and the  
private character of ownership. This discoveryof  
surplus value was referred to by Engels as the second  
important discovery of Marx (along with the  
discovery of the materialist conception of  
history). Lenin called the doctrine of surplus value  
as the corner stone of Marx’ economic theory.

Marx also analysed indetail the periodic economic  
crises that repeatedly affected capitalism. He  
explained capitalist crises also as another  
manifestation of the fundamental contradiction of  
capitalism. He thus exposed the falsehood of the  
bourgeois economists who at that time propagated  
that capitalism could not face any crisis, as the  
operation of the market wouldsolve all problems.  
They tried to present that whatever was produced by  
the capitalist would automatically be sold in the  
market place.

Marx however exposed that the nature of the working  
of capitalismitself would lead inevitably to crisis. He  
showed howcapitalists in their desperate urge to earn  
more and more profits went on madly increasing  
production. However at the same time every capitalist  
tried to maintain a higher rate of profit by cutting the

wage rates of his workers andthrowing them into  
poverty. The working class composes the largest  
section in society and the poverty of the working class  
automatically means the reduction of their capacity to  
buy the goods available in the market. Thus on the  
one hand the capitalist class goes onincreasing the  
production of goods being suppliedto the market,  
whereas on the other hand it goes on reducing the  
buying capacity of a large section of the buyers in the  
very same market. This naturally leads to a severe  
contradiction between the expansion of production  
on one hand and the contraction of the market on  
the other hand. The result is a crisis of  
overproduction where the market is flooded with  
unsold goods. Numerous capitalists are thrown into  
bankruptcy. Lakhs (100,000s) of workers are thrown  
out of their jobs and forced into starvation at the same  
as the shops are filled with goods that remained  
unused because there is no one to buy them.

Marx further concluded that the anarchy of these  
crises of capitalism could only be resolved by  
resolving the fundamental contradiction of  
capitalism between the social character of  
production and the private character of ownership.  
This could only be done by overthrowing the  
capitalist system and establishing socialism and  
communism, and thus giving a social character to  
the ownership of the means of production. Marx  
showed that the social force that would bring about  
this revolution had been created by capitalism

itself; it was the proletariat class. It was the  
proletariat alone who had no interest in continuing  
the present system of exploitation and private  
ownership. It alone had the interest and capacity to  
establish socialism.

Marx analysed how every crisis intensified the  
contradictions of the capitalist system. He described  
the process with each crisis of centralisation of capital  
intothe hands of a smaller and smaller handful of  
capitalists. This proceeded alongside the immense  
growth in the misery and discontent of the vast mass  
of workers. As the contradictions of capitalism  
sharpened, the revolutionary upheavals of the  
proletariat grew in strength, finally resulting in  
revolution, the confiscation of the capital of the  
capitalists and the building of a socialist society with a  
social character of ownership suited to the social  
character of production.

In this way, Marx, starting from the economy’s  
most basic unit – the commodity – brings out the  
nature of the economic laws governing capitalism.  
He thus exposes the scientific economic basis for  
the socialist revolution and the road to  
communism.

Chapter 9

MarxismFuses Its Links with the Working Class

As we saw earlier Marx and Engels were deeply  
involved in the revolutionarycommunist groups of  
the eighteen forties. They thus came to lead the  
Communist League which was an international body  
uniting the revolutionaries of various European  
countries. They also drafted its programme –  
the Communist Manifesto –, whichacquired world  
historic significance. However at that time –in 1848 –  
the influence of Marxismhad yet to reach the vast  
working class masses. The influence of  
the Communist League was limited and it consisted  
mainly of exiled workers and intellectuals. In fact at  
that time Marxismwas just one of the many trends  
of socialism.

The 1848 Revolution, which spread insurrection  
throughout the European continent, was the first  
major historical event where Marxismproved itself  
in practice. Marx and Engels were in Brussels when  
the Revolution first broke out in France. The Belgian  
government fearing the spread of the Revolution  
immediately expelled Marx fromBrussels and forced  
himto leave for Paris where he was soon joined by  
Engels. However as the revolutionary wave spread to  
Germany, both decided to immediately move there in  
order to directly participate in the revolutionary  
events.

There they tried to consolidate the work of the  
Communist League and the workers’ associations.  
They brought out a daily newspaper, the Neue  
Rheinische Zeitung, which served as an organof  
propagation of the revolutionary line.The newspaper  
took a line in support of radical bourgeois  
democracy as the completion of the bourgeois  
democratic revolution was then the main task in  
Germany. However the paper simultaneously  
served as the organiser of the emerging  
revolutionary proletarian party in Germany. Marx  
and Engels even tried to forma mass workers’party  
by uniting the workers’ associations of various  
provinces of Germany. The paper lasted for one year.  
With the collapse of the revolution in Germany and  
other parts of Europe, the paper was forced to close  
down and Marx was expelled by the Prussian King.  
He retreated to Paris but had to soon leave fromthere  
too because of persecution by the French authorities.  
Engels continued in Germany fighting as a soldier in  
the revolutionary armies till the very end. After  
military defeat, he escaped, and towards the end of  
1849, joined Marx, who had by then settled in  
London. England then continued to be their centre till  
the end of their lives.

The defeat of the 1848 Revolution had spread  
confusion among the revolutionaries and proletarian  
activists throughout Europe. Most of the earlier  
dominant trends of socialismcould not provide any  
proper understanding regarding the reasons for the

course of events during the revolution. It was in such  
an atmosphere that Marx took up the task of  
explaining the social forces behind the initial  
victory and later defeat of the Revolution. Since  
France was the centre and principal starting point of  
both the upsurge and decline of the revolution, Marx  
concentrated his analysis on the French events. This  
he did through his brilliant works, The Class Struggles  
in France, 1848 to 1850 and the Eighteenth Brumaire  
of Louis Bonaparte. They were Marx’first attempts to  
explain current historical events by means of the  
materialist conceptionof history. He analysed with  
complete clarity the class forces behind eachof the  
major turns andtwists in the revolution. He thus  
provided the class basis for revolutionary  
proletarian tactics. By exposing the role of various  
classes at various stages, he showed who were the  
friends and enemies of the revolution and therefore  
the approach of the proletariat to each of them.

In the following period, Marx continued his writings  
on all the major political events throughout the world.  
In all these writings he presented a clear perspective  
froma proletarian viewpoint. This distinguished them  
fromall other varieties of socialism, which proved  
incapable of providing real answers to the  
continuously changing world situation. It clearly  
established the superiority of Marxism over other  
brands of socialism as a practical tool for  
understanding and changing the world.

Simultaneously, Marx and Engels worked energetically  
to unite the weak and fragmented organisations of the  
working class. The Communist League, which had its  
main centre in Germany, faced severe repression from  
the Prussian police. Many of its members in Germany  
were put behind bars and the organisation itself was  
finally dissolved in November 1852. During the long  
period of reaction after the failure of the 1848  
Revolution Marx andEngels tried continuously to  
reorganise and revive the working class movement.  
Besides writing and publishing their works  
extensively, they maintained constant contact with the  
working class organisations in various countries,  
particularly England, France and Germany. Their  
constant attempt was to form an international  
organisation of the working class and to set up  
separate parties of the proletariat in the industrially  
developed countries.

The main work in this respect was done by Marx. He  
worked throughout this period under very difficult  
conditions. After having been driven out by the  
governments of various countries, even after Marx  
settled in London he was under constant surveillance  
of the secret police, particularly of Prussia. Besides the  
political repression Marx’ economic situation was  
always very bad. Due to the poor and disorganised  
state of the revolutionary working class movement at  
that time it was unable to support himas a full-timer.  
Thus his only source of earnings was the small  
payment per article whichhe got for writing for a

large American newspaper The NewYork Tribune.  
This was of course totally insufficient for Marx’large  
family. Theythus faced constant poverty, debt and  
even starvation. Many a time things fromthe house  
had to be pawned to provide for food. Marx had six  
children but only three survived beyond childhood.  
When his babydaughter died the burial had tobe  
delayed for a fewdays till some money was collected  
for the burial. Marx himself faced constant serious  
illnesses, which he had to struggle against to complete  
his work.

Throughout all these economic difficulties the main  
support for the Marx family was Engels. After the  
failure of the 1848 Revolution Engels had been forced  
to take up a job in his father’s Manchester firm. He  
worked there for twenty years, first as a clerk and then  
for the last five years as a partner in the firmtill 1869.  
During this period he had a substantial income, with  
which he would regularly help Marx.

Engels’ help however was not merely economic.  
Though he did not get much spare time because of his  
job he put in all efforts to continue study and help  
Marx. They corresponded very regularly and  
constantly exchanged ideas. Marx always consulted  
Engels on major questions, particularly on decisions  
regarding the international working class movement.

Their efforts finally bore fruit in 1864 with the  
formation of the International Workingmen’s  
Association – the First International. Marx soon

became its leader and was primarily responsible for  
drawing up its first programme and  
constitution. The International’s programme  
however did not contain the strong words of the  
Communist Manifesto. The First International, unlike  
the Communist League, was not an organisation  
limited to small groups of revolutionaries. In fact  
many of the sections of the International, especially  
those of England and France, represented  
organisations with a vast mass following of workers.  
However, most of these organisations did not have a  
clear and correct understanding. Thoughthey were  
composed predominantly of workers the level of  
consciousness was normally lower than that of the  
selected revolutionaries of the Communist League.  
The programme and constitution thus had to be  
formulated keeping this in mind. The correct line had  
to be presented in a manner acceptable to the member  
organisations of the International. Marx, with his  
great ideological depth and practical organisational  
experience was at that time the only person capable of  
thus drafting these documents and was therefore given  
this task. In subsequent years too, it was he, who  
drafted all the most important documents of the First  
International.

It was thus Marxismalone that could provide the  
ideological, political and organisational perspective  
for the First International. Implementation of this  
perspective meant constant struggle against the  
various anarchist and opportunist trends that arose

within the movement. Among other things the  
anarchists opposed a strong organisation whereas the  
opportunists opposed resolute struggle. Fighting both  
deviations, Marx and Engels worked to build the  
International into a mass organisation of struggle,  
uniting the workers in both Europe and America.  
This they largely succeeded in, doing leading at the  
same time to the formation of independent proletarian  
parties in many of the industrialised countries of the  
world.

By the time of the historic Paris Commune of 1871,  
Marxismhad advanced very far fromit’s position  
at the time of the 1848 Revolution. Marxismno  
longer remained as merely one of the trends of  
socialism. The earlier brands of Utopian Socialism  
had been swept away by history and it was  
Marxism alone that retained full practical  
significance. Marxismalso was no longer restricted  
to small groups but had become a mass  
phenomenon. Its influence extended to the  
proletarian movements in various industrialised  
countries. It provided the ideological leadership to  
independent proletarian parties. It headed a  
massive proletarian movement, which had begun to  
challenge the bourgeoisie. Marxismhad fused its  
links with the vast working class masses.

Chapter 10

The Lessons of the Paris Commune

The Paris Commune was the first time inhistory  
when the proletariat seized power and attempted to  
set up its own rule. The Commune could not  
consolidate its rule and was crushed within a period of  
72 days. However its experience was of world historic  
significance. During its short existence it had provided  
a glimpse of the new society. Through both its  
positive examples as well as its mistakes it had  
provided immensely valuable lessons for the working  
class of the world. Marx, in his role as leader of the  
First International, summarised the lessons of this  
great experience for the international proletariat.

The background to the Paris Commune was provided  
by the Franco-German war of 1870-71. It started in  
July 1870 with the reactionary French Emperor  
Napoleon III ordering anattackon Prussia (which  
with other smaller provinces became Germany in  
January 1871) because he mistakenly thought that the  
Prussians were in a weak position. His armies were  
rapidly defeated and Napoleon III himself surrendered  
and was taken prisoner by the Prussians in September

1870.  Napoleon III’s surrender was followed by the  
    setting up of a Republic headed by a politician named  
    Thiers. Thiers inMarch1871 signed a peace treaty  
    with the Germans. Paris however, whichhadbeen  
    surrounded by the Prussian army since September  
    1870, did not submit to Thiers. It was in the control of

the Paris National Guard, which was composed  
mainly of workers. On March 18th, 1871, Thiers sent  
his army to disarmthe National Guard. There was a  
revolt in which two of the French army generals were  
shot dead and the army was forced to retreat. Power  
had passed over into the hands of the National Guard,  
who, within a week, held elections and set up a  
Council consisting of 92 members. The Council,  
whichhad a large number of workers, became the  
organ of government. It introduced numerous  
progressive measures for the reorganisation of social  
life and the administration of the city and thus had the  
full support of the whole working people. The Paris  
Commune was however a government under constant  
attack. Fearing the strength of the working class, the  
German and French oppressors had immediately  
joined hands to crush the Commune. Germany even  
directly helped the Thiers government by releasing a  
large section of the French army who had surrendered  
and been taken prisoner in 1870. The Thiers  
government strengthened by reinforcements then  
launched a full-scale campaign to conquer Paris. The  
workers fought bravely but they were no match for  
the well equipped professional army. After many days  
of heroic fighting, resulting in thousands of martyrs,  
the Commune was crushed on May 28th, 1871. Even  
after the takeover over 30,000 Communards were  
butchered in cold blood. Over 45,000 were court-  
martialed, of whommany were executed and others  
sent to prison or to exile. It was as if the bourgeoisie

was determined to teach an unforgettable lesson to the  
workers lest they ever even dreamof seizing power  
again.

The First International was at the peak of its popular  
appeal at the time of the Franco-Prussian war and the  
Paris Commune. It had a wide struggle base among  
the workers and regularly provided guidance on  
political questions. When the Franco-Prussian war  
broke out Marx immediately brought out a document  
in the name of the General Council of the First  
International. This document is one of the first  
applications of the Marxist tactical principles  
regarding war. He called for international solidarity  
of the workers while putting the blame for the war on  
the rulers of bothFrance and Prussia. Due to the  
propaganda of the International a strong spirit of  
internationalism existed among both German and  
French workers. In fact Bebel and Wilhelm  
Liebknecht, two members of parliament and leaders of  
the German proletarian party who were Marxist  
members of the International were jailed by the  
Prussian government for voting in parliament against  
war credits.

In the initial period of the war Marx characterised it as  
a defensive war on the part of Germany because of the  
reactionary nature of the aggressive Napoleon III  
regime. He however predicted the fall of this  
reactionary ruler. When this took place Marx  
immediately brought out a document which called on

the German workers to oppose what had nowbecome  
a German war of conquest. He called for peace with  
France and recognition of the newly formed Republic.  
He characterised the Republic as being led by the  
finance aristocracy and big bourgeoisie. He however  
felt it would be premature to attempt to overthrow the  
Republic and forma workers’government. In fact  
Marx firmly opposed any attempt at insurrection in  
Paris. This was because the German enemy had  
already surrounded Paris and there was very little  
chance of any insurrection surviving in such  
circumstances.

Despite Marx’advice the activists of various anarchist  
and conspiratorial trends who had some following in  
Paris made various attempts at organising an uprising.  
When the insurrection actually took place Marx  
despite all his earlier opposition declared full and  
militant support for the Commune. He immediately  
recognised its historic significance and sent hundreds  
of letters throughout the worldtrying to build up  
support. He through messengers kept contact with the  
Communards sending advice to the Internationalists  
in the Commune. Consulting Engels, whowas an  
expert in military matters he also sent advice  
regarding the military defence of the Commune.  
Though the leadership of the Commune was in the  
hands of the members of other groups and trends, the  
Marxists within the Commune made all attempts to  
strengthen its activities and defence. After the defeat  
of the Commune the International was the principal

organisation which arranged for shelter and help to  
gain jobs for the Communards who had to flee the  
brutal repression of the French bourgeoisie.

Marx, who immediately hailed the Commune as an  
event of immense historic significance, made anin-  
depth analysis trying to draw lessons from its  
experience. This work, The Civil War in France, was  
written during the Commune but could only be  
brought out two days after the its fall. It served to  
propagate its achievements and build the correct  
approach to the Commune among revolutionaries  
and workers throughout the world.

Marx firstly highlighted the major positive and  
revolutionary measures taken by the Commune,  
which he presented as the incubation of the new  
society. He pointed out the major political decisions as  
the separation of the Church and the State, abolition  
of subsidies to the Church, replacement of the  
standing army by a people’s militia, election and  
control of all judges and magistrates, upper salary  
limit for all government officials and making them  
strictly responsible to the electorate, etc. The major  
socio-economic measures were free and general  
education, abolition of night work in bakeries,  
cancellation of employer fines in workshops, closing  
of pawnshops, seizure of closed workshops which  
were to be run by workers’cooperatives, relief to the  
unemployed, rationed houses and assistance to  
debtors. All the above measures showedthat there

being no clear direction to the Commune, all its  
decisions had the clear stamp of the actions of the  
proletariat. Despite being faced constantly by the  
desperate question of its very survival, the Commune  
through its actions provided the first glimpse of  
what type of society the coming proletarian  
revolution would bring. It provided the first  
experience of the proletariat in state power – what  
Marx and Engels referred to as the first  
dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Commune by its weaknesses also provided the  
most valuable lessons for the future struggles of the  
proletariat. These were pointed out by Marx. A  
serious weakness of the Commune was the lack of the  
clear and centralised leadership of a single proletarian  
party. From this Marx concluded that for the  
success of the revolution it was absolutely necessary  
to have the leadership of a strong, clear-sighted and  
disciplined proletarian party. The other point,  
which Marx repeatedly stressedwas the need to  
smash the earlier state machinery. In order to build  
the new workers’state it was not possible to rely upon  
the earlier state machinery of the bourgeoisie with its  
state officials who were totally committed to  
preserving the oldsocial order. Infact inorder to  
build the workers’state it was first necessary to smash  
the earlier state apparatus and get rid of all the high  
level officials associated with it.

In the period of reaction and repression following the

Commune, there was considerable confusion among  
the revolutionary forces as to how to assess the  
experiences and draw the correct conclusions. The  
anarchists, who had participated in large numbers in  
the Commune, were particularly at a loss. Marx’  
analysis gave a clear-cut position clearing all types  
of confusion. Marx also helped propagate the correct  
understanding regarding the Commune throughout  
the world. Following the Commune the bourgeoisie  
portrayed Marx as the real leader of the Commune  
and he was therefore even interviewed by the world  
press. Through these interviews he thus was able to  
present the correct stand to various countries.  
Marxismagain was providing the correct answers.

Chapter 11

Spread of Marxismand Rise of Opportunism

The period after the Paris Commune was one of  
reactionary offensive by the bourgeoisie on the  
working class movement. This had its impact on  
the First International. The Frenchsection was the  
worst hit with most of the members becoming  
refugees in other countries and severe factional fights  
among them. The German labour movement also  
faced a setback with the long arrest of the main  
Marxist leaders, Bebel and Liebknecht, who had  
opposed the war and the annexation of parts of  
France. This meant that the two of the most  
important sections in the International were  
handicapped. Simultaneously there was a split in the  
English section with some of the leaders leaving  
the International in opposition to the militant stand in  
support of the Commune taken by Marx. This  
coupled with the manipulations by the anarchists  
weakened the International. Marx and Engels decided  
to transfer the headquarters of the International from  
London to NewYork. This decision was taken in the  
1872 Congress of the International. The  
weakened International however could not revive  
and was finally dissolved in 1876.

The dissolution of the First International however did  
not stop the onward march of Marxismand the setting  
up of newproletarianparties. The period after the  
Paris Commune saw a long almost 35 year gapof

peace, without any major wars between the big  
capitalist countries on the European continent.  
During this period the labour movement in most  
industrialised countries expanded rapidly. Socialist  
parties, which had a basically proletarian composition,  
set up large and elaborate structures. Under their  
leadership grew trade unions, daily newspapers,  
worker cooperatives, etc. Working often under legal  
conditions they participated quite successfully in the  
bourgeois parliaments. It was many of these parties  
who got together to set up the Second  
International in 1889.This formation of the Second  
International gave further encouragement to the  
growth of newproletarian socialist parties in various  
parts of the world.

Marx and Engels till the end of their lives  
continued to play the role of ideological leaders and  
practical organisers of this growing working class  
movement. They provided constant theoretical inputs  
to strengthen the foundations of the growing  
movement. Marxconcentrated on further studyof  
political economy and more in-depth study of  
capitalism. The first volume of Capital came out  
in1867. After that Marx continued to struggle against  
severe ill health to try and complete the later volumes  
of this work. However it remained unfinished right  
upto his death on 14th March 1883. Engels however  
completed the monumental task of collecting together  
Marx’notes, editing themand finally publishing the  
second and third volumes of Capital. Engels in fact

also did substantial theoretical work after becoming a  
full-timer in 1869. Along with Marx, and alone, he  
brought out various works on philosophy, socialist  
theory, evolution, origin of social and political  
institutions, etc. After the death of Marx he played the  
central role in guiding and building the movement in  
various countries. Through regular correspondence he  
performed the role of a centre which was otherwise  
non-existent throughout this period. This he did till  
his death on 5th August 1895.

Alarge part of the work of Marx and Engels was in  
fighting the trends of opportunism that started  
gaining strength with the growth of the movement.  
One important trend was that of Lassalleismwhich  
arose first during the First International but continued  
also in later years. Its originator, Ferdinand Lassalle,  
was the founder of the first working class socialist  
party set up in 1863 in Germany. The main  
opportunist aspects of Lassalleism were a  
discouragement of workers struggle for higher  
wages and making appeals to the state for  
government aid to set up workers cooperatives  
which Lassalle saw as the main means of reforming  
society and gradually bringing about socialism. In  
order to fight the wrong understanding on wage  
struggles Marx wrote the work, ‘Wages, Prices and  
Profits’and presented it inthe General Council of  
the First International in 1865. The fight against  
Lassalleism continued in 1875 when Marx wrote  
the Critique of the Gotha Programme. The Gotha

programme was the programme drafted at the time of  
the unification of the Lassalleist and Marxist  
proletarian parties of Germany into one party. At that  
time the Marxists were so keenonunity that they  
made many compromises with the opportunist  
politics of Lassalleism. Marx in his Critique made a  
thorough criticismof the points that had opportunist  
politics. However the Critique was only givento a  
handful of the leading Marxist members of the  
German party. It was not circulated and very fewof  
its suggestions were brought into practice. However in  
1891 when a newparty programme was being drafted  
Engels insisted on publishing the Critique, despite the  
protests of some of the leading members of the party.  
This time the Lassalleist aspects did not appear in the  
new programme.

Other opportunist trends, which appeared, were  
similarly resolutely opposed by Marx and Engels as  
long as they were alive. After Engels’death however  
one of the most major attacks on Marxismappeared  
fromwithinthe proletarian movement itself. Since  
direct opposition to Marxismwas very difficult this  
attack came in the form of an attempt to ‘revise’  
Marxism. This trend which later came to be called  
revisionismwas initiated first by Bernstein,one of  
the leading members of the German party and also of  
the Second International. He first presented his views  
in 1898-99 within the German party. Bernstein  
proposed that because of changed conditions it was  
necessary to change all the basic formulations made

by Marx. He proposed that it was not necessary to  
have violent revolution to bring about socialism  
and that reform of capitalist institutions would  
gradually bring about socialism. As opportunism  
had been growing in the working class movement  
Bernstein’s revisionism soon found supporters in  
various parties. However at the same time many  
genuine revolutionaries rallied around in the support  
of Marxism. The debate was taken up before the  
Congress of the Second International held in1904.  
The Congress strongly condemned revisionismby a  
vote of 25 to 5, with 12 abstentions. There was also  
another compromise resolution, which did not so  
strongly condemn revisionism, which did not get  
passed because there was a tie vote of 21 to 21. Thus in  
both the resolutions there was a very big section that  
supported or did not want totake a strong stand  
against revisionism. Though the Congress finally  
condemned revisionismit was quite clear in 1904  
itself that opportunismand revisionismhad built a  
substantial base for itself at the highest levels of the  
international working class movement. The  
opposition to opportunism in many countries  
however was also strong. Aparticularly strong centre  
was in Russia, where the Bolsheviks under the  
leadership of Lenin had already waged numerous  
struggles against Russian varieties of opportunism.

Chapter 12

Marxismin Russia – Early Life of Lenin

Russia was one of the countries where Marxismand  
Marxist literature spread very early. In fact the first  
translation of Marx’principal work‘Capital’or‘Das  
Kapital’was in Russian. An edition brought out in  
1872 (just five years after the original German  
edition), was an immediate success with good sales and  
numerous positive reviews in prestigious journals. Its  
impact was so great that by 1873-74 quotes from  
‘Capital’already started appearing in the propaganda  
of radical student agitations in big Russian cities. The  
translation into Russian of other Marxist works was  
also taken up quite early by Russian revolutionaries  
attracted to Marxism.

One such revolutionary was Vera Zasulich, a woman  
revolutionary known for her attempt to assassinate the  
governor of St. Petersburg. She started correspondence  
with Marx in 1881, which she later continued with  
Engels after Marx’death. In 1883 she became a part of  
the first Russian Marxist organisation –  
the Emancipation of Labour group led by George  
Plekhanov. Plekhanov participated in the 1st Congress  
of the Second International in 1889 after which he met  
Engels for the first time. After this meeting Plekhanov  
continued to maintain close links and take guidance  
fromEngels.

Plekhanov played the principal role in establishing

Marxism in Russia. He translated andpopularised  
many of Marx and Engels’works. While combating  
the anarchist, peasant socialist views of the Narodniks  
he also made many theoretical contributions to  
Marxism. Russia at that time was under the tyrannical  
rule of the Tsar against whommany revolutionaries  
and revolutionary groups had started activities. Many  
of these groups however had leanings towards  
anarchism and terrorism. Plekhanov and  
the Emancipation of Labour group played the crucial  
role in converting considerable sections to  
Marxism. Lenin, who joined hands with this group  
at a later stage, was however, the outstanding  
figure who took ahead Marxism and the  
proletarian movement.

Lenin was the party name of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov,  
who was born on22nd April 1870, inthe cityof  
Simbirsk, which was the capital of the Simbirsk  
province. It was situated on the Volga, which is  
Russia’s biggest river. Though it was a provincial  
capital communication with the outside world were  
limited during Lenin’s youth. There was no railway  
and the main means of transport was via the steamers  
that traveled up and down the Volga. This however  
stopped during the long winter months when the river  
froze into ice and journeys had to be made on  
horseback.

Lenin’s father was a well-educated man who through  
hard work had risen fromthe level of poor peasant to

become teacher, inspector of schools and finally the  
director of elementary schools in Simbirsk province.  
He was also given the noble rank of Civil  
Councilor in 1874. He died in 1886. Lenin’s mother  
was the daughter of a rural doctor. Though she did  
not go to school she was educated at home and even  
learnt many foreign languages, which she later taught  
her children. She died in 1916. They had eight  
children of whomtwo died in early childhood and one  
in her teens. Lenin was the fourth child. All his  
brothers and sisters grew up to be revolutionaries.

Lenin was however the most influenced by his elder  
brother, Alexander. Alexander was a brilliant student  
and gold medallist of the University of Saint  
Petersburg (then the capital of Russia). He was a  
member of the secret revolutionary study-circles of  
revolutionary youth in St. Petersburg and conducted  
political propaganda among the workers. He  
ideologically stood between the Narodniks and  
Marxism. In 1887 Alexander was arrested along with  
his elder sister Anna and other comrades for trying to  
assassinate the Tsar. Anna was later released and  
banned fromSt. Petersburg. Alexander however who  
was the leader of the group was hanged on 8th March  
1887, along with four of his comrades. Lenin who was  
then only 17 years of age vowed to avenge his  
brother’s martyrdom.

Lenin froma very young age was a model student  
with a very systematic method of study. Unlike

other students, he never produced his assignments at  
the last minute. Rather, he prepared an early outline  
and draft, constantly making notes, additions and  
changes before producing his final draft. He had a  
very high level of concentration and did not talk to  
anyone who disturbed himwhile studying. He was a  
great admirer of his elder brother and at a young age  
tried toimitate Alexander in everything he did. A  
monthafter his brother was hanged, Lenin, despite  
the severe tension and grief, had to sit for his school  
leaving exams. He received a gold medal as the  
school’s best student.

Despite the gold medal, Lenin could not get admission  
ineither the St. Petersburg University or Moscow  
Universitybecause he was the brother of a known  
revolutionary. He finally gained admission in the  
smaller University of Kazan. He was however within  
three months expelled fromthe city of Kazan for  
participating in a demonstration against new  
regulations limiting the autonomy of universities and  
the freedom of students. The police officer who  
escorted himto the city limits tried to convince the  
young Lenin that he was upagainst a wall. Lenin  
however replied that the wall was a rotten one, which  
would crumble with one kick. The next year in 1888  
Lenin was allowed to return to Kazan but was not  
given readmission into the university. It is here that he  
started attending one of the secret Marxist study-  
circles.

During this period and later when the family moved  
to another province of Samara, Leninspent a large  
amount of his time in reading and study. Besides  
reading the works of Russian revolutionaries, Lenin,  
at the age of eighteen, starting reading many of  
Marx and Plekhanov’s works. He started  
propagating his knowledge of Marxism, first to his  
eldest sister Anna, and then by organising small  
discussion groups of his friends. He also tookto  
swimming, skating, mountain climbing and hunting.

In the meantime his mother made repeated attempts  
to get himreadmitted to university. He was however  
again refused at Kazan. He was also refused a foreign  
passport to go and study abroad. After many  
applications, Lenin was, in 1890, finally accepted only  
as an external law student at the St. Petersburg  
University. He could sit directly for the examinations  
without being allowed to attend lectures. Lenin was  
determined to complete his course at the same time as  
his former Kazan fellow students. He therefore  
studied on his own and completed the four-year course  
within a year. In the examinations, held in 1891, he  
received the highest marks inall subjects and was  
given a first class degree. In January 1892 he was  
accepted as a lawyer and started practice in the Samara  
Regional Court.

Lenin however was least interested in his law  
practice. While giving his exams in St. Petersburg  
he had developed Marxist contacts there and got a

supply of Marxist literature. In Samara Lenin spent  
a large part of his time giving lectures in illegal  
study circles of workers and others. He also formed  
the first Marxist study circle of Samara.Samara was  
a centre of the Narodniks and Lenin concentrated his  
energies on fighting the Narodnikideology of that  
time which had moved to liberalism. He, at the same  
time, had a great respect for the brave, selfless,  
Narodnik revolutionaries of the 1870s, many of whom  
were residing in Samara after retiring from  
politics. Lenin was always eager to learn fromthem  
about their revolutionary work, their secrecy  
techniques, and about the behaviour of  
revolutionaries during interrogation and trials. It  
was inSamara that Leninstarted his first writings,  
whichwere circulated among the studycircles. He  
also translated the Communist Manifesto into  
Russian. Lenin’s activities and influence started  
spreading beyond Samara toother provinces of the  
Volga region.

After developing well formed views Lenin now  
wanted to broaden the scope of his revolutionary  
work. With this aim, he moved in August 1893 to St.  
Petersburg, which was a major industrial centre with a  
large proletariat. As a cover he took up a job as an  
assistant lawyer to a senior barrister of St. Petersburg.  
He however did very little legal work and  
concentrated wholly on revolutionary  
activities. Lenin soon became a leading figure  
bringing newlife to the numerous secret study-

circles of St. Petersburg. He also influenced the  
Moscow circles. Besides lecturing in the circles he was  
always interested inlearning every minute detail of  
the workers’lives. In the circles he convinced a big  
section of the revolutionaries to move from  
selective propaganda (propaganda in those days was  
understood as similar to our political education  
classes today) in small circles to mass agitation  
among the broad mass of workers.

It was during this period that he met his future wife,  
Krupskaya, who had already come into contact with  
Marxismand was teaching without payment at a night  
school for workers. Many of her worker students were  
part of a study circle conducted by Lenin. Lenin  
himself would always be eager to learn fromher deep  
knowledge of the lives and work conditions of the St.  
Petersburg workers. When Lenin fell ill she used to  
visit himand gradually their friendship grew into love.

Meanwhile Lenin continued to expand his contacts in  
many more cities of Russia. In February 1895 a  
meeting of the groups in various main cities decided to  
send Lenin and another delegate fromMoscowabroad  
tomake contact with the Emancipationof Labour  
group. Lenin’s first visit to Europe lasted from  
April to September 1895. He during this period  
met Plekhanov and Axelrod of the Emancipation  
of Labour group, and other leaders of the German  
and French working class organisations. He wanted  
keenly to meet Engels but could not do so as Engels

was on his deathbed.

Upon his return to Russia he united all the Marxist  
circles of St. Petersburg into one political organisation  
called the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of  
the Working Class. The League immediately started  
agitation and organising strikes in large factories of the  
city. It also made plans for bringing out anillegal  
magazine of the workers. This magazine however  
could not be brought out. The secret police who had  
been keeping close watch on Lenin finally managed  
through the help of an informer to arrest himalong  
with proof. He was picked up inDecember 1895,  
along withthe manuscript of the first issue of the  
illegal magazine and was sent to jail.

Even fromjail Lenin managed to keep close contact  
with his comrades outside. His mother and sister  
Anna brought him numerous books and he sent  
letters in the books through a code language that  
he had taught his sister. He also sent letters written  
in milk, that served as invisible ink that became  
visible later, on being warmed up. He used black  
bread as his inkpots so that he could swallowthemas  
soon as any jail-guard came nearby. Thusfromthe jail  
Lenin could even write pamphlets and direct  
strikes, which during 1896 were on an upswing  
throughout Russia. He came to be known as the real  
leader of the League. At the same time he also started  
intense study and research on his first major  
theoretical work, The Development of Capitalismin

Russia. While studying heavily from morning to  
night, Lenin kept up his fitness by daily regular  
exercises before going to bed.

After over one year in jail Lenin was released but was  
immediately sentenced to three years exile in Siberia  
where he reachedin May 1897. Krupskaya in the  
meantime had also been arrested. Lenin proposed  
marriage to her fromSiberia. She replied simply,“If  
I’mto be a wife, so be it.”She was allowed to join him  
in Siberia where she reached in May 1898. Lenin spent  
most of his time in Siberia in theoretical work. With  
Krupskaya’s help he translated an English  
book Industrial Democracy into Russian. He also  
completed his work on the development of capitalism  
inRussia, whichwas published legally in1899. He  
also his started his struggle against the Economists

-   an opportunist trend linked to the Bernsteinian  
    revisionism mentioned inthe previous chapter. He  
    also wrote extensively on what should be the  
    programme and immediate tasks of the Russian  
    revolution. When he came out of exile in early 1900  
    he immediately started work on those tasks.

Chapter 13

Lenin and the Proletarian Party of a New Type

The most urgent and pressing task when Lenin came  
out of exile was to build the revolutionary proletarian  
party. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour  
Party (RSDLP) had been formally established in a  
Congress held in 1898 attended by 9 delegates.  
However the Central Committee elected at the  
Congress was very soon arrested. Though the banner  
of the party had been announced this Congress did  
not actuallysucceed in unifying all the groups and  
building up a single party organisational structure.  
Thus in 1900 this task remained.

The plan for building up the party had been  
worked out in detail while in exile. The key to it  
Lenin felt was the setting up of an All-Russian  
political newspaper. Lenin proposedthat the only  
way of politically and organisationally uniting the  
scattered Marxist study-circles, groups and  
organisations was through a political newspaper. This  
newspaper would be able topoliticallylink all the  
varied cells throughout Russia by presenting the  
correct line and immediately fighting all opportunist  
deviations. At the same the most difficult task of  
secretly distributing an illegal paper would by itself  
create an underground organisation trained in facing  
the repressive Russian secret police. Lenin wanted to  
first bring into action this plan before the calling of a  
Party Congress because it was also first necessary to

defeat the opportunist and revisionist trends that had  
raised their heads in the movement in the preceding  
years.

Lenin’s plan was first discussed with and approved by  
the Leagues of Struggle in various Russian cities and at  
a conference of Social Democrats, which he arranged  
todiscuss this plan. His principal associates inthis  
plan were Martov and Potresov members of the  
central group of the St. Petersburg whohad been  
arrested and sent to Siberia at the same time as him.  
The plan was to bring out the paper fromabroad as it  
was too dangerous to publish it within Russia. Lenin  
also planned for this purpose to unite with  
Plekhanov’s Emancipation of Labourgroup, which  
already existed abroad. The editorial board was to  
consist of six members – three from the  
Emancipation group abroad and three fromRussia–  
Lenin, Martov and Potresov. After making all  
arrangements the first issue of the paper came out in  
December 1900.

It was called Iskra meaning Spark. Its title page carried  
the words of the first Russian bourgeois  
revolutionaries of 1825– The Spark Will Kindle a  
Flame. Iskra was printed in various countries at  
various times–Germany, England and Switzerland. It  
was never sent directly to Russia but went by  
extremely roundabout routes until they reached the  
secret Iskra committees within Russia. The  
distributors had an extremely difficult task avoiding

the secret police and if Iskra smugglers were caught  
they would be straightaway exiled to Siberia. Iskra was  
a major tool for educating the working class with  
lectures in study circles often consisting in reading out  
articles from the paper. Iskra agents used every  
opportunityto distribute the newspaper as well as  
secret Iskra leaflets. These were distributed not only in  
the factories but alsoon the streets, intheatres, in  
army barracks, and through the post. In large cities  
they were widely scattered through the streets or from  
the balconies in theatres. It worker localities they were  
distributed late at night or early mornings by keeping  
them in factory courtyards and near water-pumps  
where they would be seen in the morning. After each  
such operation, which was called sowing, a particular  
marking would be made on a nearby wall so that a full  
report could be got in the morning as to the impact of  
the night’s work. In small towns and villages,  
the Iskra pamphlets would be brought in peasant carts  
on market days and pasted on walls. All this was  
dangerous work as discovery meant immediate arrest  
and the possibility of banishment to Siberia. The  
comrades involved in this work slowly started building  
up into the teamof professional revolutionaries on the  
basis of whomLenin planned to build the proletarian  
party.

As to the structure and composition of the party  
itself, Lenin considered that it should consist of  
two parts: a) a close circle of regular cadres of  
leading party workers, chiefly professional

revolutionaries, that is, party workers free fromall  
occupation except party work and possessing the  
necessary minimum of theoretical knowledge,  
political experience, organisational practice and the  
art of facing and fighting the tsarist police; and b) a  
broad network of local party organisations and a  
large number of party members enjoying the  
sympathy and support of hundreds of thousands of  
working people. As the process of building such a  
party was proceeding through the help of Iskra, Lenin  
gave direction to this process through his articles and  
books. Of particular significance were Where To  
Begin? What Is To Be Done? and Letter to a  
Comrade on Organisational Questions. In these  
works he laid down the ideological and  
organisational basis of the proletarian party.

Besides the organisational questions a major battle  
waged by Lenin was the fight against  
the Economists, who wanted to restrict the Social  
Democratic Party merely to the economic struggle  
of the workers. They had grown in strength in Russia  
during Lenin’s period in exile and Lenin realised  
that Economism had to be ideologically defeated  
before the convening of the Party Congress. He  
launched a direct attack on themparticularly through  
his book What Is To Be Done? Lenin exposed how  
the Economists’ views meant bowing to the  
spontaneity of the working class movement and  
neglecting the role of consciousness and leading  
role of the party. He showed howthis would lead

to slavery of the working class to capitalism. While  
mouthing Marxism, the Economists wanted to  
convert the revolutionary party into a party of  
social reform. Lenin thus showed how  
the Economists were actually Russian representatives  
of the opportunist trend of Bernsteinian revisionism.  
Lenin’s book, which was widely distributed in Russia,  
succeeded in decisively defeating Economism. It thus  
laid down the principles which later became the  
ideological foundation of the Bolshevik party.

The actual birthof the Bolsheviktrend within the  
RSDLP took place at the second Party Congress,  
which took place in July-August 1903. The main  
debate at the Congress was regarding what should  
be the nature of the party and thus who should be  
given membership in the party. Lenin who had in  
mind a tight, effective, professional revolutionary  
based party proposed that all party members  
should work in one of the party organisations.  
Martov, on the other hand, had as his model the  
loosely functioning legal parties, which had become  
common in the Second International at that time.  
He thus proposed loose criteria for membership,  
whichwould allowanyone who accepted the party  
programme and supported the party financially, to be  
eligible for party membership. He thus was ready to  
give party membership to any party sympathiser. In  
the vote on this point the majority was with Martov.  
However later when some opportunist sections  
walkedout of the Congress the majority came on

Lenin’s side. This was reflected in the elections to the  
Central Committee and Editorial Board of Iskra,  
which went according to Lenin’s proposals. The  
differences between the two groups however remained  
strong and continued even after the Congress. From  
that time Lenin’s followers, who received the  
majority of votes in the elections at the Congress,  
have been called Bolsheviks (which means majority  
in the Russian language). Lenin’s opponents, who  
received the minority of votes, have beencalled  
Mensheviks (which means minority in the Russian  
language).

Immediately after the Congress the Mensheviks  
started manipulations and splitting activities. This  
created a lot of confusion. In order to clear the  
confusion, Lenin, in May 1904, brought out his  
famous book, One Step Forward, Two Steps Back. It  
gave a detailed analysis of the intra-party struggle both  
during and after the Congress and on that basis  
explained the proletarian party’s main organisational  
principles which later came to formthe organisational  
foundations of the Bolshevik party. The circulation of  
this book brought the majority of the local  
organisations of the party to the side of the  
Bolsheviks. However the central bodies, the party  
organ and the Central Committee went into the hands  
of the Mensheviks who were determined to defeat the  
decisions of the Congress. The Bolsheviks were thus  
forced to formtheir own committee and start their  
own organ. Both groups also started making separate

preparations for organising their owncongress and  
conference. These were held in 1905. The split in the  
party was complete. The foundations however had  
been laid for the building of the true revolutionary  
party – the proletarian party of a new type.

Chapter 14

Russian Bourgeois Revolution of 1905 :  
Development of Proletarian Tactics

The period of the split inthe RSDLPcame at the  
beginning of a period of major changes in the world  
situation. The long 35-year gap of peace inEurope  
between the main capitalist countries was broken with  
a series of wars. The age of imperialismhad dawned  
and the newimperialist powers started fighting for  
capturing and expanding markets. They entered into a  
number of regional wars. An important war among  
these was the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05. These  
regional wars were only a way by which the  
imperialist powers were preparing themselves for  
the devastating World War I of 1914-18 for the re-  
division of the world.

This same period was also a period of a new  
upsurge of revolutions. The mainsource of these  
revolutions was however nownot Europe but Asia.  
The first of these revolutions was the Russian  
bourgeois revolution of 1905, which was followed by  
the Turkish, the Persianand the Chinese bourgeois  
revolutions. The most important of these  
revolutions, from the point of the role of the  
proletariat and the development of Marxist  
revolutionary tactics, was the 1905 Russian  
revolution. Its starting point was the Russo-Japanese  
war.

The Russo-Japanese war, which started on  
8th February 1904, ended in defeat for the Tsar and a  
humiliating peace treaty on23rd August 1905. The  
Bolsheviks adopted a clear revolutionary  
standpoint to the war, opposed to their own  
government and opposed to any false notions of  
nationalismor patriotism. Their approach was that  
the defeat of the Tsar would be useful, as it would  
weaken Tsardom and strengthen the  
revolution. This is actually what happened. The  
economic crisis of 1900-03 had already aggravated the  
hardships of the toiling masses. The war further  
intensified this suffering. As the war continued and  
the Russian armed forces faced defeat after defeat the  
people’s hatred for the Tsar increased. They reacted  
with the great revolution of 1905.

The historic movement started with a big Bolshevik-  
led strike of the oil workers of Baku inDecember

1904.  This was the‘signal’for a wave of strikes and  
    revolutionary actions throughout Russia. In  
    particular, the revolutionary storm broke with the  
    indiscriminate firing upon and massacre of a  
    demonstration of unarmed workers on 22nd January  
    1905, in St. Petersburg. The Tsar’s attempt to crush  
    the workers in blood only inspired a still more fierce  
    response fromthe masses. The whole of 1905 was a  
    period of rising wave of militant political strikes by  
    workers, seizure of land and landlord’s grain by  
    peasants, and even a revolt by the Russian Navy sailors  
    of the battleship Potemkin. Twice the Tsar, in a bid to

divert the struggle, offered first a‘consultative’and  
then a ‘legislative’ Duma (Duma is the Russian  
parliament). The Bolsheviks rejected both Dumas  
whereas the Mensheviks decided to participate. The  
high tide of the revolution was between October and  
December 1905. During this period, the proletariat,  
for the first time in world history, set up the Soviets of  
Workers’ Deputies – which were assemblies of  
delegates fromall mills and factories. These were the  
embryo of revolutionary power, and became the  
model for the Soviet power set up after the Socialist  
Revolution in 1917. Starting with an all-Russia  
political strike in October, the revolutionary struggles  
went on rising until the Bolshevik-led armed  
uprisings, in December, in Moscow, and various other  
cities and nationalities throughout the country, these  
were brutally crushed and after that the tide of the  
revolution started to recede. The revolution was  
however not yet crushed and the workers and  
revolutionary peasants retreated slowly, putting up a  
fight. Over a million workers took part in strikes in  
1906, and 740,000 in1907. The peasant movement  
embraced about half of the districts of Tsarist Russia  
in the first half of 1906, and about one-fifth in the  
second half of the year. The crest of the revolution had  
however passed. On 3rd June 1907, the Tsar effected a  
coup, dissolved the Duma he had created, and  
withdreweven the limited rights he had been forced  
to grant during the revolution. Aperiod of intense  
repression under the Tsarist Prime Minister, Stolypin,

called the Stolypin reaction, set in. It was to last till  
the next wave of strikes and political struggles in 1912.

Though the 1905 Revolution was defeated it shook  
the very foundations of Tsarist rule. It also, in the  
short space of three years, gave the working class  
and peasantry a rich political education. It was also  
the period when the Bolsheviks proved in practice  
the basic correctness of their revolutionary  
understanding regarding the strategy and tactics of  
the proletariat. It was in the course of this  
revolution that the Bolshevik understanding  
regarding the friends and enemies of the revolution  
and the forms of struggle and forms of  
organisation got firmly established.

The Bolsheviks and Mensheviks had an opposite  
understanding on all the above questions. The  
Menshevik understanding was the reformist and  
legalist understanding that had by then grown  
common in many parties of the Second International.  
It was based on the understanding that the Russian  
revolution, being a bourgeois revolution, had to be led  
by the liberal bourgeoisie, and therefore the  
proletariat should not take any step that would  
frighten the bourgeoisie and drive it into the arms of  
the Tsar. The Bolshevik understanding on the other  
hand was the revolutionary understanding that the  
proletariat could not rely on the bourgeoisie to lead  
the revolution and would have to itself take up the  
leadership of the revolution. It was on this

revolutionary basis that the Bolsheviks developed  
their understanding on all the other important  
strategic and tactical questions of the revolution.

Thus the Bolsheviks called for the extension of the  
revolution and the overthrowof the Tsar through  
armed uprising; the Mensheviks tried to control the  
revolution within a peaceful framework and attempted  
to reform and improve Tsardom. The Bolsheviks  
pushed for the leadership of the working class, the  
isolation of the liberal bourgeoisie and a firmalliance  
with the peasantry; the Mensheviks accepted alliance  
with and leadership of the liberal bourgeoisie and did  
not consider the peasantry as a revolutionary class to  
be allied with. The Bolsheviks were ready for  
participation in a provisional revolutionary  
government to be formed on the basis of a successful  
people’s uprising and calledfor the boycott of the  
Duma offered by the Tsar; the Mensheviks were ready  
for participation in the Duma and proposed to make it  
the centre of the “revolutionary forces” of the  
country.

The Menshevik understanding was not an isolated  
example of a reformist trend. In fact the Menshevik  
understanding was fully representative of the  
understanding of the main leading parties of  
the Second International at that time. Their stand was  
basically supported by the leaders of the International  
at that time. ThusLenin and the Bolsheviks were  
not only fighting the reformismof the Mensheviks

but also the reformist understanding that then  
dominated the so-called Marxist parties of  
the International. Lenin’s formulations were  
however a continuation and development of the  
revolutionary understanding of Marx and Engels. It  
was a further development of the Marxist  
revolutionarytactics appliedin the new conditions  
brought about by the growth of capitalisminto a new  
stage–imperialism. Lenin brought out these tactics in  
his various writings during the course of the  
revolution and particularly in his book, Two Tactics  
of Social-Democracy in the Democratic  
Revolution. This book written in July 1905 after the  
Bolsheviks and Mensheviks held separated Congresses,  
brought out the essential differences inthe strategy  
and tactics proposed by the two groups.

The fundamental tactical principles presented by  
Lenin in this and other works were:

1.  The main tactical principle running through all  
    Lenin’s writings is that the proletariat can and  
    must be the leader of the bourgeois democratic  
    revolution. It order to do this two conditions were  
    necessary. Firstly, it was necessary for the proletariat  
    to have an ally who was interested in a decisive victory  
    over Tsardomand who might be disposed to accept  
    the leadership of the proletariat. Lenin considered that  
    the peasantry was such an ally. Secondly, it was  
    necessary that the class which was fighting the  
    proletariat for the leadershipof the revolution and

striving to become its sole leader, would be forced out  
of the arena of leadership and isolated. Lenin  
considered that the liberal bourgeoisie was such a  
class. Thus the essence of Lenin’s main tactical  
principle of the leadership of the proletariat meant  
at the same time the policy of alliance with the  
peasantry and the policy of isolation of the liberal  
bourgeoisie.

2.  As regards the forms of struggle and forms of  
    organisation, Lenin considered that the most  
    effective means of overthrowing Tsardom and  
    achieving a democratic republic was a victorious  
    armed uprising of the people. In order to bring this  
    about Lenin called for mass political strikes and the  
    arming of the workers. He also called for achieving  
    the 8-hour working day and other immediate demands  
    of the working class in a revolutionary way by  
    disregarding the authorities and the law. Similarly he  
    called for the formation of revolutionary peasant  
    committees to bring about changes like seizure of land  
    in a revolutionary way. These tactics of disregarding  
    the authorities paralysed the Tsar’s state machinery  
    and released the initiative of the masses. It led to the  
    formation of revolutionary strike committees in the  
    towns and revolutionarypeasant committees in the  
    countryside, which later developed in the Soviets of  
    Workers’ Deputies and the Soviets of Peasants’  
    Deputies.
    
3.  Lenin further held that the revolution should not
    

stop after the victory of the bourgeois revolution  
and the achievement of a democratic republic. He  
proposed that it was the duty of the revolutionary  
party to do every thing possible to make the  
bourgeois- democratic revolution pass into the  
Socialist revolution. He thus giving concrete form  
to Marx’ concept of uninterrupted revolution.

These tactical principles became the basis for the  
Bolshevik practice during the following period. It  
finally led to the victory of the proletariat in 1917  
October Revolution and the establishment of the first  
workers’state.

Chapter 15

World War I : Opportunism v/s Revolutionary  
Tactics

The dawn of imperialismfromthe turn of the century  
brought with it the wars by the imperialist powers for  
the capture of colonies. An example was the Russo-  
Japanese war mentioned in the previous chapter. This  
war took place because both Russia and Japan wanted  
control over Manchuria in Northern China and  
Korea. Similar wars for capturing or recapturing  
colonies started breaking out in various parts of the  
world. Thus it became of crucial importance for the  
international proletarian movement to adopt the  
correct revolutionary position on the questions of  
colonialismand war. This therefore came up before  
the Congresses of the Second International.

Opportunismhad however, by then, spread quite  
extensively within the parties of the Second  
International. Many leading sections of the parties  
in the imperialist countries had in fact started  
taking the standpoint of the bourgeoisie on many  
of the crucial political questions. This was seen very  
clearly at the 1907 Congress of the Second  
International where the questions of colonialism  
and war were first taken up.

On the question of colonialism, the leading body of  
the Congress–the Congress commission–adopted a  
resolution on colonial policy and placed it before the

general body for approval. This resolution while  
criticising the bourgeoisie’s colonial policy for  
namesake did not reject totally the principle of  
capturing colonies. It infact argued that under a  
socialist regime it could be in the “interests of  
civilization” to capture colonies. Such an openly  
imperialist positionof these so-called Marxists was  
strongly opposed by the revolutionaries in the general  
body and the resolution was finally defeated, but only  
by a small margin of only 127 votes to 108.

Similar opportunismof the leadership was seen in the  
case of the standon the question of war. Bebel, a  
knownleader and a close follower and associate of  
Marx and Engels prepared the resolution. The  
resolution however was left vague without any specific  
direction or course of action to be taken by the  
members in the event of war. This again was opposed  
strongly by the revolutionaries – particularly Rosa  
Luxembourg of Germany and Lenin. They then  
proposed an amendment which gave a clear-cut  
direction to the members of the International to  
fight to prevent war, to fight to end the war  
quickly in case it started, and to make full use of  
the economic and political crisis in the case of war  
to arouse the people and bring about revolution.  
This was a continuation of the revolutionary  
proletarian position on war that Marx had already  
clearly laid down. Since the opportunists could not  
openly oppose this understanding, this resolution was  
passed by the Congress. As the war danger grew

nearer the 1910 and 1912 Congresses of the  
International again discussed and adopted resolutions  
regarding war. They decided that all socialists in  
parliament should vote against war credits. They also  
repeated in their resolutions the wording of the  
amendment proposed in1907 by Luxembourg and  
Lenin.

However the hold of opportunismover the Second  
International was sogreat that most of the leaders  
who passed these resolutions had absolutely no  
intention of standing by these decisions. This was seen  
whenthe World War I actuallybroke out in July-  
August 1914. The GermanSocial-Democratic Party,  
which was the undoubted leader of the Second  
International, led the way. The trade-union  
bureaucrats, instead of trying to rouse the workers  
against the war and for revolution, immediately  
entered into a no-strike agreement with the  
employers. In the party caucus (fraction) meeting that  
was held before the parliamentary vote on war credits,  
a large majority voted in support of the war. Only a  
handful of revolutionaries led by Karl Liebknecht and  
Rosa Luxembourg opposed. Kautsky, who was at that  
time the main ideological leader of the Second  
International, voted to abstain. Thus on 4th August  
1914 the German Social Democratic Party threw  
aside all the previous Congress resolutions and  
voted unanimously in parliament to support the  
imperialist war. For the revolutionary proletariat,  
the Second International ceased to exist fromthat

date. The German party was immediately followed by  
the majority of socialists in France, Britain, Belgium  
and other countries. The Second International broke  
up into separate social-chauvinist parties warring  
against each other.

The Bolsheviks were almost the only party to stand  
by the anti-war resolutions. In the context of  
the Second International leaders falling totally into  
opportunism, it was left to Lenin and the  
Bolsheviks to uphold and implement the correct  
Marxist position regarding the World War. Lenin  
immediately brought out writings presenting this  
correct understanding. The Central Committee of  
the RSDLP (B) gave a call to “turn the imperialist  
war into civil war” and to build a new Third  
International in place of the Second  
International. Lenin started the process of building  
the Third International by uniting all the leftist anti-  
war forces. Though these forces started holding  
conferences from 1915 onwards much confusion  
continued. Lenin had to take up the task of clearing  
this confusion and establishing among these elements  
the correct revolutionary position on the principles of  
socialism in relation to war and alsothe tasks of  
revolutionary social democrats at the international  
level and in Russia. Lenin did this through his various  
writings propagated both within Russia as well as the  
international level.

The principles and tasks Lenin outlined can be

presented in the following manner:

Firstly, socialists are not pacifists who are  
opponents of all war. Socialists aim at establishing  
socialismand communism, which by eliminating all  
exploitation will eliminate the very possibility of war.  
However in the fight to achieve the socialist system  
there will always be the possibility of wars which  
are necessary and are of revolutionary significance.

Secondly, while deciding the attitude to be adopted  
towards a particular war, the main issue for  
socialists is this: what is the war being waged for,  
and what classes staged and directed it. Thus Lenin  
pointed out that during the period of the bourgeois  
democratic revolution, Marx had supported the wars  
waged by the bourgeoisie, which were against  
feudalismand reactionary kings. Because these wars  
were aimed at abolishing feudalismand establishing or  
strengthening capitalism, they were progressive or just  
wars. Adopting similar criteria Lenin points out that  
in the era of imperialismand proletarian revolution  
socialists will support all such wars that take ahead the  
World Socialist Revolution. According to suchan  
understanding Lenin gave examples of the types of  
wars that may be called just or progressive wars: –

1.  national wars waged by a colonial or semi-  
    colonial country against its imperialist exploiter, 2)  
    civil wars waged by the proletariat and other  
    oppressed classes against their feudal or capitalist  
    ruling classes, 3) socialist wars for the defence of

the socialist fatherland.

Thirdly, Lenin pointed out that on the basis of the  
above understanding there was nothing just or  
progressive about the World War I. He compared  
the imperialist war to a war between a slave-holder  
who owns 100 slaves and a slave-holder who owns 200  
slaves for a more‘just’redistribution of slaves. The  
essential purpose of the World War I was for  
redistribution of the colonial slaves. Thus there could  
not be anything progressive or defensive or just war. It  
was an unjust, reactionary war. The onlystand  
towards it could be the call to convert the  
imperialist war into civil war. The only use thus of  
such a war was to take advantage of this war to  
make revolution. In order to do this, Lenin pointed  
out that it was advantageous that one’s own country is  
defeated in the war. Defeat would weaken the ruling  
class and facilitate the victory of revolution. Thus any  
socialist revolutionary must work for the defeat of  
his own government in the war.

Finally, Lenin pointed out that it was the duty of  
socialists to participate in the movement for peace.  
Nevertheless while participating in the movement  
for peace, it is their duty to point out that no real  
and lasting peace is possible without a  
revolutionary movement. In fact, whoever wants a  
just and democratic peace must stand for civil war  
against the governments and the bourgeoisie.

Though these principles and tactics were propagated

among all the parties of the Second International, the  
onlyones toimplement themin practice were the  
Bolsheviks. It was this approach to the war that helped  
themto make use of the revolutionary crisis situation  
created by the war and within three years achieve the  
victory of Great October Socialist Revolution of 1917.

Chapter 16

Lenin’s Analysis of Imperialism, the Highest Stage  
of Capitalism

Marx’ analysis of the laws of motionof capitalism  
belongs to the stage of free competitive capitalism  
where a large number of capitalist producers  
competed in the market. He analysed to some extent  
the process of centralisation of capital. He however  
did not live long enough to see the start of a newstage  
in capitalism — the stage of imperialism. This  
happened at the start of the 20th century and it was  
left to Lenin to analyse this process. In 1897-98 Lenin  
made some initial analysis of the development of the  
capitalist world market but did not analyse in full the  
subject of imperialism. However with the start of the  
World War I which was a war caused by imperialismit  
was necessary to do a full analysis of imperialismto  
understand the economic basis of the war and the  
political consequences for the proletariat.

This question became all the more urgent in 1915  
when the opportunist and revisionist leader of  
the Second International, Karl Kautsky, wrote a book  
on imperialism where he argued that the world  
economic system was moving towards ‘ultra-  
imperialism’where there would be stability and no  
risk of war. His argument was similar to some people  
who analyse globalisation today and argue that,  
because of the growthof multinational groups and  
corporations and the spread of their capital to all

countries, these multinationals will be opposed to war  
and there is therefore no danger of a world war. This  
theory presented during the World War I gave a false  
picture of imperialism. Since such a false theory was  
presented by Kautsky who was then recognised as the  
main theoretician of Marxism it was absolutely  
necessary to oppose this theory and present the  
correct understanding. It was necessary to clear the  
confusion created by the Second Internationalists and  
give the correct analysis and present the correct tactics  
before the international working class movement. In  
order to do this Lenin, in 1916, did extensive research  
and produced his famous work, Imperialism, the  
Highest Stage of Capitalism. Besides this main work  
he also wrote many other articles linking this basic  
economic analysis to the tactics of the proletariat.

In the first place, Lenin tried to clear the confusion  
created by Kautsky and other opportunists as to  
‘What is Imperialism?’ In order toanswer this, he  
pointed out that imperialismis a specific historical  
stage of capitalism. Its specific character is three-  
fold: imperialism is (1) monopoly capitalism; (2)  
parasitic, or decaying capitalism; (3) moribund  
capitalism or capitalism on its deathbed. The  
replacement of free competition by monopoly is the  
fundamental economic feature, the essence of  
imperialism.

Monopoly Capitalism manifests itself in five  
principal forms: (1) Cartels, syndicates and trusts —

The concentration of production has reached a degree  
which gives rise to these monopolistic associations of  
capitalists who join together to crush other  
competitors. They fix prices, allot production among  
themselves and make other arrangements and  
agreements to prevent others from entering and  
succeeding in the market. They play a decisive role in  
economic life. (2) The monopolistic position of the  
big banks and the creation of finance capital  
through the merger of monopoly industrial capital  
and bank capital – During Lenin’s time this had  
already reachedthe level where three, four or five  
giant banks manipulated the whole economic life in  
the main industrialised counties. (3) The export of  
capital which gains particular importance – this  
feature that is different from the export of  
commodities under non-monopoly capitalism is  
closely linked to the economic and political partition  
of the world. (4) The economic partition of the  
world by the international cartels – At Lenin’s time  
there were already over one hundred such  
international cartels, which commanded the entire  
world market and divided it among themselves in a  
‘friendly’manner. Of course this‘friendliness’would  
only be temporary and would last until war took place  
for a redivision of markets. (5) The territorial  
(political) partition of the world (colonies) among  
the biggest capitalist powers –This process of  
colonisation of all the backward countries of the  
world was basically completed at the time of the dawn

of imperialism. Any further colonies could only be  
got through redivision of the world, through war.

On the basis of the above features, Lenin defines  
imperialism in the following way: “Imperialism is  
capitalismin that stage of development in which  
the dominance of monopolies and finance capital  
has established itself; in which the export of capital  
has acquired pronounced importance; in which the  
division of the world among the international  
trusts has begun; in which the division of all  
territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist  
powers has been completed.”

The fact that imperialismis parasitic or decaying  
capitalismis manifested first of all in the tendency  
to decay, which is characteristic of every monopoly  
under the system of private ownership of the  
means of production. As compared the rapid  
expansion under free competition, there is a tendency  
for production as a whole to decline under monopoly.  
Technological progress is discouraged and new  
inventions and patents are deliberately  
suppressed. Secondly, the decay of capitalism is  
manifested in the creation of a huge stratumof  
rentiers, capitalists who live without working but  
merely on the basis of the interest or dividend they  
earn on their investments. Thirdly, export of  
capital is parasitismraised to a high pitch as it  
means the open exploitation of the cheap labour of  
the backward countries. Fourthly, finance capital

strives for domination, not freedom. Political  
reaction all along the line is a characteristic feature of  
imperialism. Corruption, bribery on a huge scale and  
all kinds of fraud become common. Fifthly, the  
exploitation of oppressed nations and especially the  
exploitation of colonies by a handful of “Great”  
Powers, increasingly transforms the imperialist  
world into a parasite on the body of hundreds of  
millions in the backward nations. It reaches the  
stage where a privileged upper stratum of the  
proletariat in the imperialist countries also lives  
partly at the expense of hundreds of millions in the  
colonies.

Imperialism is moribund capitalism, because it is  
capitalismin transition to socialism. Monopoly, which  
grows out of capitalism, is already dying capitalism,  
the beginning of its transition to socialism. The  
tremendous socialisation of labour by imperialism  
produces the same result. The basic contradiction of  
capitalismbetween the social character of production  
and the private character of ownership only gets  
further intensified under imperialism. Thus Lenin  
says,“Imperialismis the eve of the social revolution of  
the proletariat.”

Chapter 17

The Great October Socialist Revolution

As mentioned earlier, in Chapter 14, the period after  
the defeat of the 1905 Revolution was a period of  
extreme repression and reaction under the  
leadership of the Tsar’s Prime Minister, Stolypin.  
The working class was made the main target of attack.  
Wages were reduced by 10 to 15 per cent, and the  
working day was increased by 10 to 12 hours. Black  
lists of worker activists were drawn up and they were  
not given jobs. Systems of fines on workers were  
introduced. Any attempt toorganise was met with  
savage attacks by the police and goondas organised by  
the Tsar’s agents. In such a situation many intellectuals  
and pettybourgeois elements started retreating and  
some even joined the camp of the enemy.

In order to face this newsituation, the Bolsheviks  
changedover from offensive tactics (like general  
strike and armed uprising used during the period  
of the 1905 Revolution) to defensive tactics.  
Defensive tactics meant the tactics of gathering  
together of forces, the tactics of withdrawing the  
cadres underground and of carrying on the work of  
the party from underground, the tactics of  
combining illegal work with work in the legal  
working-class organisations. Open revolutionary  
struggle against Tsardom was replaced by  
roundabout methods of struggle.

The surviving legal organisations served as a cover for  
the underground organisations of the party and as a  
means of maintaining connections with the masses. In  
order to preserve their connections with the  
masses, the Bolsheviks made use of he trade unions  
and other legally existing people’s organisations,  
such as sick benefit societies, workers’ co-operative  
societies, clubs, educational societies and even  
parliament. The Bolsheviks made use of the platform  
of the State Duma to expose the policy of the Tsarist  
government, to expose the liberal parties, and to win  
the support of the peasants for the proletariat. The  
preservation of the illegal Party organisation enabled  
the party to pursue a correct line and to gather  
together forces in preparation for a new rise in the tide  
of the revolution.

In implementing these tactics the Bolsheviks had to  
wage struggle against two deviations within the  
movement – the Liquidators and the Otzovists  
(Recallists). The Liquidators, who were Mensheviks,  
wanted to close down the illegal party structure and  
set up a legal‘labour’party with the consent of the  
government. The Recallists, whowere from among  
the Bolsheviks, wanted to recall all the Bolshevik  
members of the Duma, and also withdrawfromthe  
trade unions and all other legal forms of organisation.  
Theywanted only the illegal form of organisation.  
The result of both sets of tactics would have been to  
prevent the party fromgathering together the forces  
for a newadvance of the revolution. Rejecting both

deviations, the Bolsheviks used the correct tactics  
of combining both legal and illegal methods and  
were able to gain a strong presence in many  
workers’ organisations and also win over a number  
of Menshevik worker organisations. This  
strengthened the party and prepared it for the next  
upswing in the revolutionary movement, which  
started from1912.

The Bolsheviks held a separate Party Conference in  
January 1912 and constituted themselves as a separate  
party–the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party  
(Bolsheviks) [RSDLP (B)]. At this conference itself  
they assessed the rise in the revolutionary movement  
which was seen fromthe rise in the number of strikers  
in 1911. At this conference and at later meetings of the  
Central Committee, newtactics were decided upon  
according to the new situation. This involved  
extending and intensifying the struggles of the  
workers.

An important aspect of the tactics during this  
period was the starting of the daily  
newspaper, Pravda (Truth), which helped to  
strengthen the Bolshevik organisations and spread  
their influence among the masses. Earlier the  
Bolsheviks had a weekly paper, which was meant for  
advanced workers. Pravda, however, was a daily mass  
political newspaper, aimed at reaching out to the  
broadest sections of the workers. Started on 5th May  
1912, it lasted for two and a half years. During this

period it faced numerous problems and heavy fines  
from the government’s censors. It was suppressed  
eight times but reappeared againeachtime under a  
slightly changed name. It had an average circulation of  
40,000 copies. Pravda was supported by a large  
number of advanced workers–5600 workers’groups  
collected for the Bolshevik press. ThroughPravda,  
Bolshevik influence spread not only among the  
workers, but also among the peasants. In fact during  
the period of the rise of the revolutionary movement  
(1912-14) the solid foundation was laid for a mass  
Bolshevik party. As Stalin said,“The Pravda of 1912  
was the laying of the corner-stone of the victory of  
Bolshevismin 1917.”

With the outbreak of war in 1914, the revolutionary  
situation further ripened. The Bolsheviks did  
extensive propaganda among the workers against the  
war and for the overthrow of Tsardom. Units and cells  
were also formed in the army and the navy, at the  
front and in the rear, and leaflets distributed calling  
for a fight against the war. At the front, after the  
Party’s intensive agitation for friendship and  
brotherhood between the warring armies’ soldiers,  
there were increasing instances of refusal of army units  
to take the offensive in 1915 and 1916. The  
bourgeoisie and landlords were making fortunes out  
of the war, but the workers and peasants were  
suffering increasing hardships. Millions had died  
directly of wounds or due to epidemics caused by war  
conditions. In January and February 1917, the

situation became particularly acute. Hatred and anger  
against the tsarist government spread.

Even the Russian imperialist bourgeoisie, were wary  
of the Tsar, whose advisers were working for a  
separate peace with Germany. They too, with the  
backing of the British and French governments,  
planned to replace the tsar througha palace coup.  
However the people acted first.

From January 1917 a strong revolutionary strike  
movement started inMoscow, Petrograd, Baku and  
other industrial centres. The Bolsheviks organised big  
street demonstrations in favour of a general strike. As  
the strike movement gained momentum, on March 8,  
International Women’s Day, the working women of  
Petrograd were called out by the Bolsheviks to  
demonstrate against starvation, war and Tsardom. The  
workers supported the working women with strikes  
and by March 11, the strikes and demonstrations had  
taken on the character of an armed uprising. The  
Bureau of the Central Committee on March 11 issued  
a call for continuation of the armed uprising to  
overthrow the tsar and establish a provisional  
revolutionary government. On March 12, 60,000  
soldiers came over to the side of the revolution, fought  
the police and helped the workers overthrowthe Tsar.  
As the news spread, workers and soldiers everywhere  
beganto depose the Tsarist officials. The February  
bourgeois-democratic revolution had won. (It is called  
February Revolution because the Russian calendar at

that time was 13 days behind the calendar in other  
parts of the world and the date of the victory of the  
revolution was February 27th according to the  
Russian calendar).

As soon as Tsardom was overthrown, on the  
initiative of the Bolsheviks, there arose Soviets of  
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. However, while the  
Bolsheviks were directly leading the struggle of the  
masses in the streets, the compromising parties, the  
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries (a petty-  
bourgeois party which was a continuation of the  
earlier Narodniks) were seizing the seats in the Soviets,  
and building up a majority there. Thus they headed  
the Soviets inPetrograd, Moscowand a number of  
other cities. Meanwhile the liberal bourgeois  
members of the Duma did a backdoor deal with the  
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries and  
formed a Provisional Government. The result was  
the formation of two bodies representing two  
dictatorships: the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie,  
represented by the Provisional Government, and  
the dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry,  
represented by the Soviets of Workers’ and  
Soldiers’ Deputies. Lenin called this dual power.

Immediately after the bourgeois revolution Lenin  
whiled still in Switzerland, wrote his famous Letters  
fromAfar, where he analysedthis dual power. He  
showed how the Soviets were the embryo of the  
workers’ government, which had to go ahead and

win victory in the second stage of the  
revolution—the socialist revolution. Their allies in  
this would be the broad semi-proletarian and small  
peasant masses and the proletariat of all countries.

On April 16, 1917, Lenin arrived in Petrograd after a  
long period of exile, and the very next day presented  
his famous April Theses before a meeting of  
Bolsheviks. He called for opposing the Provisional  
Government and working for a Bolshevik majority  
in the Soviets and transferring state power to the  
Soviets. He presented the programme for ensuring  
peace, land, and bread. Lastly, he called for a new  
party Congress with a new party name, the  
Communist Party, and for building a  
new International, the Third International. The  
Mensheviks immediately attacked Lenin’s Theses and  
gave a warning that ‘the revolution is in danger’.  
However within three weeks, the first openly held  
All-Russia Conference (Seventh Conference) of the  
Bolshevik Party, approved Lenin’s report based on  
the same Theses. It gave the slogan, ‘All Power to  
the Soviets!’ It also approved a very important  
resolution, moved by Stalin, declaring the right of  
nations to self-determination, including secession.

In the following months, the Bolsheviks worked  
energetically according to the Conference line,  
convincing the masses of workers, soldiers and  
peasants of the correctness of their position. The  
Sixth Party Congress was also held in August 1917

after a gap of ten years. Due to the danger of attack  
fromthe Provisional Government, the Congress had  
to be held in secret in Petrograd, without the presence  
of Lenin. Stalin presented the main political  
reports, which called for the preparation for armed  
uprising. The Congress also adopted new Party  
Rules which provided that all Party organisations  
shall be built on the principles of Democratic  
Centralism. It also admitted the group led by Trotsky  
into the Party.

Soon after the Congress, the Commander-in-Chief of  
the Russian Army, Gen. Kornilov, organised a revolt  
of the army in order to crush the Bolsheviks and the  
Soviets. However the soldiers of many divisions were  
convinced by the Bolsheviks not to obey orders and  
the revolt failed. After the failure of this revolt the  
masses realised that the Bolsheviks and the Soviets  
were the only guarantee for achieving peace, land,  
and bread, which were their urgent demands.  
Rapid Bolshevisation of the Soviets took place, the  
tide of the revolutionwas rising, and the Party  
started preparing for armed uprising.

In this period, Lenin, for security reasons, was forced  
to stay in Finland, away fromthe main arena of battle.  
During this period, he completed his book, The State  
andRevolution, which defended anddeveloped the  
teachings of Marx and Engels on the question of the  
state. While particularly exposing the distortions on  
this question byopportunists like Kautsky, Lenin’s

work then had tremendous theoretical and practical  
significance at the international level. This was  
because, as Lenin sawclearly at that time itself, the  
Russian February bourgeois revolution was a link  
in a chain of socialist proletarian revolutions being  
caused by the World War I. The questionof the  
relationshipbetweenthe proletarian revolution and  
the state was no longer merely a theoretical question.  
Because of the revolutionary situation created by the  
war it was now a question of immediate practical  
importance and it was necessary for the international  
proletarian movement and the masses to be educated  
as to correct understanding regarding this.

As the revolutionary tide rose Lenin again landed in  
Petrograd on October 20, 1917. Within three days of  
his arrival, a historic Central Committee meeting  
decided tolaunchthe armed uprising withina few  
days. Immediately representatives were sent to all  
parts of the countryand particularly to the army  
units. On becoming aware of the plan for the uprising,  
the Provisional government started an attack on the  
Bolsheviks, on November 6, 1917, the eve of the  
holding of the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets.  
The Red Guards and revolutionary units of the army  
retaliated and by November 7, 1917, state power had  
passed into the hands of the Soviets.

Immediately the next day the Congress of Soviets  
passed the Decree on Peace and the Decree on  
Land. It formed the first Soviet government—the

Council of People’s Commissars—of which Lenin  
was elected the first Chairman. The Great October  
Socialist Revolution had established the  
dictatorship of the proletariat.

It was however a long battle before the workers’  
power was consolidated. Firstly the war with  
Germany had to be ended. This was finally done by  
signing the Brest-LitovskTreaty inFebruary 1918.  
This too however did not bring a lasting peace. As  
soon as the World War I ended, the victorious  
imperialist powers of Britain, France, Japan and  
America started direct and indirect intervention and  
help to the old ruling classes of Russia to wage a civil  
war against the Soviet state. This civil war lasted till  
the end of 1920. The Soviet state emerged victorious  
but at the end of the war the economy was in ruins.

Chapter 18

The Formation of the Third International

The end of the World War I was a period of  
revolutionary upsurge throughout the world. The  
success of the October Revolution had an impact in  
numerous countries, even where Marxismhad little or  
no influence. Europe, the main battlefield of the War,  
was in the deepest revolutionary crisis. The war had  
resulted in the overthrowof four emperors and the  
break-upof their four great empires–the Russian,  
German, Austro-Hungarian (Habsburg), and Turkish  
(Ottoman). The state structures were in shambles and  
the masses were inthe mood for revolt. The mass  
protests started even before the completion of the war.  
In January 1918, a wave of mass political strikes and  
anti-war demonstrations swept throughout central  
Europe. This was followed by revolts inthe armed  
forces of various countries. There was also a national  
upsurge, whichledto the formationof manynew  
states after the break-up of the old empires.

In Germany and Hungary however the crisis led to  
revolution. In November 1918 the German sailors  
mutinied and this immediately spread a wave of revolt  
throughout Germany resulting inthe overthrowof  
the emperor and the establishment of a republic under  
the leadership of the Social-Democrat Party. Soviets  
were immediately established in Berlin and other  
cities. These were however crushed in January 1919  
after two weeks of street fighting against the

reactionary military forces, which had been  
reorganised by the Social-Democrat government. Later  
a Soviet Republic was formed in Bavaria (a province of  
Germany) in April 1919. But this too was crushed.

In Hungary the Communists led a coalition with the  
Social-Democrats and took control of the government  
in March 1919. They were however thrown out within  
five months by military pressure from Allied  
governments. The struggles of the workers continued  
for at least four more years but both these revolutions  
finally ended in failure.

Nevertheless the rising tide of revolution and the  
success of the revolution in Russia had led to  
formation of Communist Parties in many  
countries. Areal basis nowexisted for a union of  
the Communist Parties, for the formation of  
the Third, Communist International. As  
mentioned earlier, Leninand the Bolsheviks had  
given the call for the formation of the Third  
International in 1914 itself. Now they took the  
initiative for actually setting it up.

In January 1919 Lenin addressed an open letter to the  
workers of Europe and America urging themto found  
the Third International. Soon after invitations for an  
international congress were sent out. In March 1919,  
the First Congress of the Communist Parties of  
various countries, held in Moscow, founded  
the Communist International.The Congress set up  
an Executive Committee of the Third, Communist

International.

Just a month after the First Congress, Lenin explained  
the historical significance of the Third International in  
the following way: “The First International laid the  
foundation of the proletarian, international  
struggle for socialism. The Second  
International marked a period in which the soil was  
prepared for the broad, mass spread of the  
movement in a number of countries. The Third  
International has gathered the fruits of the work of  
the Second International, discarded its opportunist,  
social-chauvinist, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois  
dross, and has begun to implement the dictatorship  
of the proletariat.” He thus pointed out that the  
most significant aspect of the Third International was  
that it now represented the proletariat that had  
succeeded in seizing state power and nowhad begun  
to establish socialism.

After intense preparatory work, the Second Congress  
of the Communist International held in July 1920 was  
a major success with a wide representation from 41  
countries. Lenin made major contributions to  
Marxist theory in connection with this Congress.  
He prepared what he intended as a handbook of  
Communist party strategy and tactics, which was  
distributed among the delegates of the Congress. It  
was called “Left-Wing” Communism, an Infantile  
Disorder, and concentrated on correcting the  
‘leftist’ errors then prevalent in many parties who

had joined the International. Lenin also prepared  
the Theses on the National and Colonial  
Question adopted at the Congress. It was a  
landmark document which laid the Marxist-  
Leninist theoretical foundations for understanding  
and leading the national liberation struggles then  
gathering momentumin all the colonies and semi-  
colonies. Besides, Lenin outlined the basic tasks of  
the Communist International and the Theses on  
the Agrarian Question adopted at this Congress.  
The Congress also adopted theses on the role of the  
Communist Party in the proletarian revolution, on  
the trade union movement, on Communist Parties  
and parliament, and the Statutes and Conditions of  
admission of the Communist International. In its  
statutes the Comintern (Communist International)  
clearly declared that it “breaks once and for all with  
the traditions of the Second International, for  
whomonly white-skinned people existed”.

Besides theoretical formulations, the International,  
through its Executive Committee started playing a  
prominent role in guiding the parties and movements  
in the various member countries. In particular, it tried  
to make the utmost of the post-war revolutionary  
situation in the capitalist countries, which continued  
till 1923. However due primarily to the betrayal of  
the Second International Social-Democrats, as also the  
ideological and organisational weaknesses of the  
Communist Parties in these countries, revolution  
could not be successfully completed in any other

capitalist country.

The Comintern however played an important role in  
establishing, developing and guiding the newly formed  
Communist parties in the colonies and semi-colonies.  
During the nineteen twenties as the national liberation  
movements inthese countries advanced rapidly, the  
Comintern attempted to guide and train the  
Communist Parties to provide the leadership to these  
movements. It was for the first time that Marxismwas  
building a base among the people of the backward  
countries of the world.

Chapter 19

The National and Colonial Question

The earliest national movements arose in Western  
Europe. These national movements were mainly led  
by the bourgeoisie in their fight against feudalism. The  
main aimof these national movements was to unite  
into one nation and state a large territory, which was  
under the rule of numerous feudal lords. This was  
necessary for the bourgeoisie to get a single large  
market and to avoid the harassment and domination  
of the various feudal lords. Thus the bourgeois  
revolution against feudalism and the national  
movement to establish a single nation-state often  
combined into one. Thus the national movement was  
not normally a struggle for independence from  
oppression by another nation. In the whole of  
Western Europe, the only place where a national  
movement for independence took place was when  
Ireland fought to free itself fromBritain.

Marx and Engels lived inthis period, when the  
later national liberation struggles were yet to break  
out in a major way. They thus did not devote much  
attention to developing Marxist theory on the  
national question. Marx however formulated the  
basic stand inrelation to the Irish Questionby  
calling on the English proletariat to support the  
national struggle of the Irish people and oppose its  
national oppression.

The next phase of nationality movements came in  
Eastern Europe, with the spread of capitalism, and  
the weakening of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian  
empires. Nationality movements and organisations  
starting growing in the whole of East Europe,  
including Russia. It was necessary for the international  
proletarian movement and the RSDLP to have a  
proper understanding and stand onthe question. It  
was during this period that Stalin, in 1913, made the  
first systematic Marxist presentation on the national  
question. Stalin himself was a Georgian, a member of  
an oppressed nationality in Russia, where a national  
movement was rapidly developing. In Georgia it was  
therefore doubly necessary to present the correct  
Marxist understanding and take the correct political  
stand. This is what Stalin attempted to do in his  
pioneering work, Marxism and The National  
Question.

In his work Stalin started by defining what is a  
nation. He defined a nation as “a historically  
evolved, stable community of people, based upon  
the common possession of four principal attributes,  
namely: a common language, a common territory,  
a common economic life, and a common  
psychological make-up manifesting itself in  
common specific features of national  
culture.” Stalin rejected the concept of nation based  
merely on religion or culture, like the Jews. He  
insisted that a community should have all the above  
characteristics to be called a nation.Stalin proposed

that all such nations should have the right to self-  
determination. This right of self-determination  
however cannot be limited to autonomy, or to linking  
up in a federation, as some other parties of that time  
were proposing. The right of self-determination had  
to include the right of secession, i.e. to separate and  
exist as an independent state. However Stalin  
pointed out that howto exercise the right depended  
on the concrete historical circumstances at a particular  
point of time. It was up to the revolutionaries to try  
and influence the nation’s decision regarding self-  
determination. The decision of the revolutionary  
party would be based on whether autonomy, or  
federation, or secession, or any other course would be  
in the best interests of the toiling masses, and  
particularly the proletariat.

Though Stalin’s presentation clarified many questions,  
it was still incomplete because it did not link the  
national question to imperialismand the question of  
colonies. This was only done after Lenin’s analysis of  
imperialismin 1916. On the basis of an analysis of  
imperialism, Lenin linked the question of self-  
determination of nations to the national-liberation  
struggles being waged in the colonial  
countries. Thus it came to cover the vast majority of  
the world’s peoples. It did not remain merely an  
internal state problemof a fewcountries, which had  
oppressed nationalities within their boundaries. The  
national question became a world problem, a  
question of the liberation of the oppressed peoples

of all dependent countries and colonies from the  
burden of imperialism.

Thus when Lenin, in 1916, presented his Thesis on  
The Socialist Revolution and The Right of Nations to  
Self-Determination, he included all the countries of  
the world in his analysis. He divided the countries of  
the world into three main types:

First, the advanced capitalist countries of Western  
Europe and the United States of America. These  
are oppressor nations who oppress other nations in  
the colonies and within their own country. The task  
of the proletariat of these ruling nations is to  
oppose national oppression and support the  
national struggle of the peoples oppressed by their  
imperialist ruling classes.

Secondly, Eastern Europe and particularly Russia.  
The task of the proletariat in these countries is to  
uphold the right of nations to self  
determination. In this connection the most difficult  
but most important task is to merge the class struggle  
of the workers in the oppressing nations with the class  
struggle of the workers in the oppressed nations.

Thirdly, the semi-colonial countries, like China,  
Persia, Turkey, and all the colonies, which then had  
a combined population amounting to a billion.  
With regard to these colonial countries, Lenin took  
the stand that socialists must not only demand the  
unconditional and immediate liberation of the

colonies without compensation, but must also give  
determined support to the movement for national  
liberation in these countries and assist rebellion  
and revolutionary war against the imperialist  
powers that oppress them.

This was the first time within the international  
socialist movement that such a clear stand had been  
taken on the national and colonial questions. There  
was naturally thus some debate and confusions. One  
such argument was that support to self-determination  
and national liberation went against proletarian  
internationalism. It argued that socialismaimed at the  
merger of all nations. Lenin agreed that the aimof  
socialismis to abolish the division of mankind into  
small states, to bring nations closer together, and to  
even merge them. However he felt it would be  
impossible to achieve this by the forcedmerger of  
nations. The merging of nations could only be  
achieved only by passing throughthe transition  
period of complete liberation of all oppressed  
nations i.e. their freedom to secede. While  
presenting the party programme in 1917 Lenin  
said, “We want free unification, that is why we  
must recognise the right to secede. Without  
freedom to secede, unification cannot be called  
free.” This was the proletariat’s democratic approach  
to the national question, which stood opposed to the  
bourgeoisie’s policy of national oppression and  
annexation.

Chapter 20

Early Life and Revolutionary Contributions of  
Stalin upto the 1917 Revolution

In the initial years after the October Revolution,  
Lenin directly guided all the affairs of state and the  
party. In August 1918 there was an attempt on his life  
by a women member of the Socialist Revolutionary  
Party, which left two bullets in his body. Lenin was  
weakened by this attempt, but continued his rigorous  
work schedule, which onlyleft him three to four  
hours sleep. This overwork soon started having a  
serious impact onhis health, particularly his brain.  
Fromend 1921 he started getting severe headaches and  
spells of vertigo (an illness whichcauses giddiness)  
which affected his work. In May 1922 he suffered a  
paralytic stroke which affected his right hand and leg  
and his power of speech. Fromthat time on till his  
death despite Lenin’s many efforts to recover and get  
back to work, he could not play any effective  
role. Just before Lenin’s stroke, the Central  
Committee had in April 1922, elected Stalin as the  
General Secretary. It was thus Stalin who took over  
the leadership of the Party during Lenin’s illness  
and after his death on 21st January 1924.

Stalin (meaning man of steel), was the most popular  
of many party names of Joseph Vissarionovich  
Dzhugashvili who was born on 21st December 1879,  
in Gori, a small town of Georgia, which was then an  
oppressed nationality within the Russian Empire

(today Georgia is an independent country). His  
parents were poor and illiterate, descendants of serfs.  
His father, a few years after being released from  
slavery to his landlord, had shifted, in 1875, fromhis  
village near Tiflis, the capital of the Caucasus (a  
backward region of the Russian Empire, which was  
home to Georgia and several other oppressed  
nationalities). He set up a small shoemaker’s shop in  
Gori, which was the equivalent of a district town. He  
was however not able to earn much and left his wife  
and child in Gori to go and take up a job in a shoe  
factory in Tiflis, where he died in 1890.

Since Stalin’s father did not contribute much to the  
household, his mother, Ekaterina was the one who  
looked after himand brought himup. She worked  
long hours as a washerwoman and it was her earnings  
that paid for all the expenses of the household. She  
had three children before Stalin, who all died soon  
after birth. Stalin being her only surviving son, she  
made all efforts to give him a proper education.  
Despite her poverty, she did not send her son to work  
as would have been normal. She sent Stalin, at the age  
of nine, to the local church school. She herself put in a  
lot of effort and learnt to read and write later in old  
age. Ekaterina was thus a remarkable example of the  
grit and determination of the working masses.

Stalin personally experienced poverty from his  
earliest childhood days. His house consisted of two  
extremely small rooms, which served as shop,

workshop and home. Though Stalin was strong and  
hardy, he suffered an attack of smallpox when six or  
seven years of age that left lifelong pock marks on his  
face. He also had a blood infection, which brought  
himnear death and permanently handicapped his left  
arm.

During his five years at the Gori School, Stalin was  
noted for his intelligence and his exceptional memory.  
It was here that Stalin came first into contact with  
rationalist ideas and went against religion. He started  
writing poetry and was himself influenced by  
Georgian literature and poetry, which had strong  
nationalist trends. It was during these years itself  
that Stalin was filled with strong feelings of  
fighting against social injustice and against the  
oppression of his people.

Due to his poverty it would have been impossible  
for Stalin to go for higher education. However he  
was recommended as the ‘best student’ for a  
scholarship, by the school headmaster and the local  
priest. This enabled himto continue his studies from  
October 1894 at the topmost institution of higher  
learning in the Caucasus. This was the Theological  
Seminary (a college for training to become a Christian  
priest) at Tiflis. Stalin’s five years at the Tiflis  
seminary were crucial formative years when he  
became a Marxist.

Georgia, in Stalin’s youth was in a constant state of  
unrest. One of the sources of unrest was the rebellious

mood of the peasantry, where the abolition of  
serfdom had been delayed even after it had been  
abolished in Russia. The other source was the constant  
inflowof revolutionary ideas fromRussia. This was  
because the Tsarist government had a long history of  
deporting to the Caucasus, manyof its rebels and  
bourgeois revolutionaries. Later these deportees  
included even Marxist worker revolutionaries like  
Kalinin, the future President of the Soviet Union, and  
Alliluyev, Bolshevik organiser and later Stalin’s father-  
in-law.

The Tiflis seminary was one such centre of unrest. It  
was the main breeding ground of the local  
intelligentsia and also the main centre of opposition to  
the Tsar. In 1893, just a year before Stalin joined the  
seminary there was a strike, which led to the dismissal  
of 87 students. The main leaders of the strike later  
became prominent Marxists and revolutionaries. One  
of the leaders, Ketskhoveli, was also fromStalin’s Gori  
school, just three years his senior. He soon became  
Stalin’s first political mentor.

Stalin, in the first year itself immersed himself in  
reading all sorts of radical literature. This he had to  
do secretly, because most books of non-religious and  
political nature were strictly banned in the seminary.  
His poetry, radical and political in nature, was  
published for the first time, under another name, in a  
leading Georgianmagazine. This was also the time  
when Stalin, at the young age of fifteen, came into

contact with secret Marxist study circles. Soon  
Stalin came under the vigilance of the seminary  
authorities and was even sent to the punishment cell  
for reading forbidden literature. Around this time he  
joined a secret debating circle in the seminary itself.  
This further increasedhis activities, whichbrought  
him more often into conflict with the seminary  
authorities.

At the age of eighteen, in August 1898, he  
joined Messame Dassy (meaning The Third  
Group), the first group of Socialists in  
Georgia, whose leaders later became prominent  
Mensheviks. Later Stalin would say, “I became a  
Marxist because of my social position (my father  
was a worker in a shoe factory and my mother was  
also a working woman), but also ...because of the  
harsh intolerance and Jesuitical discipline that  
crushed me so mercilessly at the Seminary.... The  
atmosphere in which I lived was saturatedwith  
hatred against Tsarist oppression.” Outside the  
Seminary, in the city of Tiflis, the workers during this  
period were on the move. These years sawthe first  
strikes in the Caucasus. As soon as Stalin joined  
the Messame Dassy he was given the task of  
running a few workers’ study circles. This he did by  
holding secret meetings in the workers’ bastis  
during the short free time that he got from the  
seminary. Meanwhile the seminary authorities were  
looking for an opportunity to deal with Stalin. Finally  
he was expelled fromthe seminary in May 1899, on

grounds of not having appeared for his examinations.

Expulsion fromthe seminary however did not see  
much change in Stalin’s revolutionary activities. After  
a short stay with his mother in Gori, he was back in  
Tiflis, organising and educating, while staying among  
the workers. In December 1899, he took up a job as  
a clerk with the Tiflis geophysical observatory. This  
job though paying very little, took very little time  
and provided an ideal cover fromthe Tsarist secret  
police.

Under this cover, Stalin continued to expand his  
activities. The next year, in1900, he organised and  
spoke at the first May Day celebration to be held in  
the Caucasus. Due to Tsarist repression, this 500  
strong meeting had to be held, not in the city but in  
the mountains above Tiflis. The meeting was an  
inspiring event which led to strikes in the factories and  
railways in the following months. Stalin was one of  
the main organisers. The next year it was decided to  
hold the May Day demonstration openly in the  
middle of Tiflis, but the main leaders were arrested in  
March 1901 itself. Stalin’s roomtoo was raided but he  
managed to escape. Fromthat day onwards till the  
success of the revolution in 1917, Stalin led the life  
of an underground professional revolutionary. His  
first task was to take over the leadership of the  
organisation and go ahead and organise the May Day  
event despite the loss of the main leaders. This he did  
successfully, and despite arrests and violent attacks by

the police, a historic 2000 strong demonstration was  
held.

These first years of Stalin in the Socialist organisation  
were also days of intense debate on Economismand  
other issues. Within the Georgian organisation,  
Stalin always opposed the opportunists and stood  
with the left wing. When Iskra started, Stalin’s group  
was the first to become its enthusiastic supporters and  
distribute it in Tiflis. They soon started an illegal  
paper in the Georgian language, in September 1901,  
called Brdzola (meaning The Struggle). Stalin who was  
one of its principal writers with many articles  
basically upholding the Iskra line. Of particular  
importance was a detailed article The Russian Social  
Democratic Party and Its Immediate tasks, which  
came out in December 1901.

In November 1901, Stalin was elected to the Social-  
Democratic Committee of Tiflis, which was the  
effective leading body then for the whole of the  
Caucasus. He was immediately sent to Batum, a  
small town of 25,000 population, which was a new  
centre of the oil industry linked by oil pipeline to the  
bigger and older oil-town Baku. He soon formed a  
town committee there under cover of a New Year’s  
party. He also set up a secret press in the single room  
where he was staying. Many leaflets were brought out  
which led soon to struggles of the workers. One such  
struggle led to police firing in which fifteen workers  
were killed. All these activities were done despite

oppositionby the local Socialists who later became  
Mensheviks. Finally after just four and a half months  
in Batum, Stalin was arrested in April 1902 at a secret  
Batumcommittee meeting. The secret press however  
remained undiscovered. It was during the Batum  
period that Stalin took one of his many party  
names, by which he remained famous for the many  
years he worked in the Caucasus. He was  
called Koba, which meant the indomitable or  
unconquerable in Turkish, and was the name of the  
people’s hero of one of the poems of Stalin’s  
favourite writers of his youth days.

Stalin spent one and a half years in various jails. In  
jail he maintained a strict discipline, rose early,  
worked hard, read much, and was one of the chief  
debaters in the prison commune. He was also  
known as a patient, sensitive and helpful  
comrade. After his jail period when no charges could  
be proved against him he was still banished in  
November 1903 to eastern Siberia. While in prison,  
he was, in March 1903, elected to the Executive of  
the newly formed All-Caucasian Federation of  
Social-Democratic groups. Since it is very rare for  
an imprisoned comrade to be elected to a  
committee, this action gives an idea of the  
importance of Stalin in the Caucasian organisation.  
Stalin’s banishment to Siberia coincided with the build  
up to the Russo-Japanese war. Stalin and his comrades  
made use of the confusion to escape almost  
immediately on arrival inSiberia. By end January

1904 he was back in Tiflis.

As soon as Stalin returned he was called upon to take a  
stand on the issues that had led to the split between  
the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. The majority of the  
Socialists in the Caucasus were Mensheviks and even  
many of the Bolsheviks were for compromise. Despite  
this large majority for the Mensheviks, Stalin soon  
took a stand with Lenin and the Bolsheviks. He  
started writing in the Georgian party press in  
vigorous support of the Bolshevik line. In his first  
article he wrote that the party is “the militant  
group of leaders” and “must be a coherent  
centralised organisation”. His strong political  
position brought himinto contact with Lenin who,  
from abroad, asked for copies of Stalin’s articles.  
Along with his ideological battle against the  
Mensheviks, Stalin, at the same time, was deeply  
involved in the revolutionary struggles that were  
building upthroughout the countryas part of the  
1905 Revolution. Stalin’s centre was the Caucasus.

Besides participating in organising the workers’  
strikes, Stalin immediately started the practical  
implementation of the Bolshevik call for preparation  
for armed uprising. He became the main organiser,  
inspirer and guide of the military organisation in  
the Caucasus. An efficient and secret laboratory for  
explosives was also set up. Through the struggles a  
number of fighting squads were set up. They  
participated in the numerous revolts, in attacks on

ruling class goonda gangs, and kept contact with  
peasant guerrillas. In the later period of  
downswing of the revolution, when the party faced  
a serious shortage of funds, some of the best  
fighting squads were used for major and daring  
money actions. Stalin played the principal role in  
building up and directing this very secret Technical  
branch of the Party. He also wrote articles during  
this period explaining the Marxist approach to  
insurrection.

In December 1905, Stalin attended his first All-Russia  
Conference of the Bolsheviks, where it was decided to  
build unity with the Mensheviks. It is here that he  
met Lenin for the first time. He alsoattended the  
April 1906 UnityCongress where he was the only  
Bolshevik out of eleven delegates fromthe Caucasus.  
The rest were all Mensheviks. He was also the only  
Bolshevik fromthe Caucasus who attended the 1907  
Congress. At bothCongresses one of the points of  
discussion were resolutions led by the Mensheviks and  
Trotsky, calling for bans on armed actions and money  
seizures. However the Caucasus continued to be the  
main centre for such actions with an estimate of 1150  
such actions taking place there between 1905 to 1908.

Towards the end of 1907 Stalinwas elected on the  
Baku committee. This oil-town of 50,000 workers had  
workers of various nationalities and religions facing  
severe exploitation. Stalin soonunited the workers  
and developed the lone centre of struggle during the

dark period of the Stolypin reaction. Adopting a new  
identity he set up residence and a secret printing press  
in the Muslimpart of the city. It was in this period  
that Stalin started writing for the first time in Russian.  
In 1908, Stalin was arrested, but continued to write  
articles and guide party activities frominside the jail.  
In 1909, he was againbanished, but again escaped  
within four months.

Stalin returned via St. Petersburg and found the  
disorganised state of the party headquarters in the  
capital. On returning to Baku he wrote strongly  
regarding the state of affairs and called for an All-  
Russia paper brought out fromRussia. He also later  
called for the practical directing centre to be  
transferred to Russia. After many months of intensive  
work in Baku and articles for the party organ abroad,  
Stalin was again arrested in March 1910. After some  
months in jail he was again banished where he  
remained till June 1911. This time being forbidden to  
return to the Caucasus or any big city he settled in a  
town near St. Petersburg and Moscow. He was  
however again arrested within two months. After a  
few months in jail he was again released but had to live  
outside the big cities.

It was during this period that the first Bolshevik  
Central Committee, elected by the January 1912  
Bolshevik Conference, coopted Stalin on to the  
Committee, in its very first meeting. One of Stalin’s  
first tasks after becoming CCMwas to bring out

the first issue of the Bolshevik daily paper Pravda.  
He was however almost immediately arrested again.  
After three months in prison and two months  
banishment in Siberia he escaped again. He reached St.  
Petersburg in time to lead the campaign for the  
elections to the Duma. Though the Bolsheviks won  
onlysix seats, it representedeighty percent of the  
industrial workers.

At the end of 1912 and beginning of 1913, Stalin  
spent a fewweeks abroad where he met and had  
detailed discussions with Lenin and other  
comrades. It was during this period that he wrote  
his famous theoretical book onthe National  
Question. He returned to St. Petersburg in  
February 1913, but was betrayed within a week by  
another member of the Central Committee,  
Malinovsky, who was an agent of the Tsarist secret  
police. This agent also betrayed another CCM,  
Sverdlov. Both Stalin and Sverdlov were banished to  
the remotest parts of Siberia fromwhere escape was  
the most difficult. Lenin during this period made  
elaborate plans to arrange for their escape but the  
escape plans themselves were made through the same  
secret agent. Rather than arrange escape this agent  
only arranged for closer watch to be kept on the  
CCMs. Thus Stalin was forced to remain this time  
in exile for four long years until the February  
bourgeois Revolution of 1917 resulted in the  
overthrowof the Tsarist regime. It was then that  
he was allowed to return to St. Petersburg, where

he arrived on 12th March 1917. From then till  
Lenin’s arrival in April, he led the party centre.

Looking back over Stalin’s political life of around  
twenty years before the Revolution, it stands out as  
a model of courage, self-sacrifice, dedicationand  
devotion to the cause of revolution. Besides the  
long years in prison and banishment, Stalin’s life  
was almost throughout in the underground in close  
and living contact with the masses. In such a  
difficult life of total dedication there was hardly  
any time for Stalin to have much of a ‘private life’.  
His first marriage was in his youth to Ekaterina  
Svanidze, the sister of one of his Socialist comrades  
at the Tiflis Seminary. They had one son, who after  
Ekaterina’s death, during the 1905 Revolution, was  
brought up by her parents. Stalin second marriage  
was to Nadezhda Alliluyeva, the daughter of one of  
Stalin’s close worker comrades. He had had close  
links with the family and it was they who always sent  
parcels of food, clothing and books during his  
banishment days. This second marriage however  
only took place when both were assigned to  
Tsaritsyn (later renamed Stalingrad) during the  
Civil War. This was after the October Revolution.

Chapter 21

Socialist Construction – the Russian Experience

Around the time of the October Revolution there  
were two types of so-called Marxist views with regard  
to the building of socialism.

One was the viewrepresented by the Mensheviks and  
others like them. These people were opposed to going  
ahead to the socialist revolution and wanted power to  
remain in the hands of the bourgeoisie. Their  
argument was that since capitalismhad not advanced  
sufficiently and concentrated the means of  
production, particularly in agriculture, the time was  
not appropriate for the proletariat to capture power.  
Theyproposed that the proletariat should wait for  
some time till capitalismhad been advanced to some  
extent under the rule of the bourgeoisie. This would  
create the conditions for the nationalisation of all the  
means of production and for the construction of  
socialism. The Mensheviks were thus altogether  
against the proletariat seizing power and going ahead  
with a programme of socialist construction.

The other viewwas represented by a group within the  
Bolshevik party called‘Left’Communists. Their stand  
was that power should be captured and all the means  
of production immediately nationalised even by means  
of seizing the property of the small and middle  
peasants and other producers. These ‘Left’  
Communists thus wanted to take an antagonistic stand

to the peasantry and thus drive away the main ally of  
the revolution.

Lenin, in a struggle against these two trends, drew  
up the correct path for socialist construction. The  
main aspects of Lenin’s path of socialist  
construction can be outlined as follows:

a) The proletariat should not lose the chance but  
make full use of the favourable conditions to seize  
power. Waiting will only mean that capitalismwill  
go ahead and ruin millions of small and medium  
individual producers.

b) The means of production in industry should be  
confiscated and converted into public property.

c) The small and medium individual producers  
should gradually be united in producers’ co-  
operatives, i.e., in large agricultural enterprises,  
collective farms.

d) Industry should be developed to the utmost and  
the collective farms should be placed on the  
modern technical basis of large-scale production.  
The property of the collective farm should not  
confiscated, but on the contrary they should be  
generously supplied with first-class tractors and  
other machines;

e) Exchange through purchase and sale, i.e.  
commodity production should be preserved for a  
certain period, because the peasants would not

accept any other form of economic tie between  
town and country. However trade should only be  
through Soviet trade—between the state, co-  
operative, and collective farm. This should be  
developed to the full and the capitalists of all types  
and descriptions should be ousted from trading  
activity.

Of these five points, the first two steps, the seizure of  
power and the nationalisation of big industrywere  
completed in the first fewmonths itself. However the  
further steps in the process of socialist construction  
could not be takenup immediatelybecause of the  
extremely difficult conditions of all-sided enemy  
attack faced by the first proletarian state. Due to the  
civil war the very survival of the state was in question.  
In order to face this all-round attack, the Party had to  
mobilise the whole country to fight the enemy. Aset  
of emergency measures called‘War Communism’ was  
introduced.

Under War Communism the Soviet government took  
over control of middle and small industries, in  
addition to large-scale industry; it introduced a state  
monopoly of the grain trade and prohibited private  
trading in grain; it established the surplus-  
appropriation system, under which all surplus  
produce of the peasants had to be handed over to the  
state at fixed prices; and finally it introduced universal  
labour service for all classes, making physical labour  
compulsory for the bourgeoisie, thus releasing

workers required for more important responsibilities  
at the front. This policy of‘War Communism’was  
however of a temporary nature to fulfil the needs of  
war. It helped mobilise the whole people for the war  
and thus resulted in the defeat of all the foreign  
interventionists and domestic reactionaries by the end  
of 1920 and the preservation of the independence and  
freedomof the new Soviet Republic.

From1921 there was another turn in the situation in  
Russia. After completing victory in the civil war, the  
task had to shift to the peaceful work of economic  
restoration. For this a policy shift was made fromWar  
Communismto the New Economic Policy (NEP).  
According to this, the compulsory surplus  
appropriation from the peasants was discontinued,  
private trade was restarted and private manufacturers  
were allowed to start small businesses. This was  
necessary because the War Communismmeasures had  
gone too far ahead and were being resented by certain  
sections of the mass base of the party—particularly the  
peasantry. However the Trotskyites strongly opposed  
the NEP as nothing but a retreat. Lenin, at the Tenth  
Congress of the Party, in March 1921, countered the  
Trotskyites and convinced the Congress of the policy  
change, which was then adopted. He further gave a  
theoretical substantiation of the correctness of the  
NEP inhis Report on the Tactics of the Russian  
Communist Party presented before the Third  
Congress of the Communist International in July

1921.  The NEP continued till end 1925, when the

Fourteenth Party Congress took the decision of  
moving to the next phase of socialist construction,  
that of socialist industrialisation.

Socialist Industrialisation: The Soviet Union was at  
that time still a relatively backward agrarian country  
with two-thirds of the total production coming from  
agriculture and only one-third fromindustry. Further  
being the first socialist state, the questionof being  
economically independent of imperialism was of  
central importance. Therefore the path of socialist  
construction had to firstly concentrate onsocialist  
industrialisation. In Stalin’s words, “The conversion  
of our country froman agrarian into an industrial  
country able to produce the machinery it needs by  
its own efforts—that is the essence, the basis of our  
general line.” Thus the main focus was on heavy  
industry which would produce machines for other  
industries and for agriculture.

This policy succeeded in building a strong industrial  
base independent of imperialism. It also enabled the  
defence of the socialist base in the World War II. Also  
industry expanded at a pace several times faster than  
the most advanced imperialist countries thus proving  
the immense superiority of the socialist system. The  
principal factor in this was the wholehearted  
participation in increasing production by the whole  
working class. At a time when the whole capitalist  
world was reeling under a very severe economic  
crisis socialist industry was marching ahead

without any problems whatsoever.

However, due to special emphasis on priority  
development of heavy industry, agriculture was  
neglected in the plans. Thus in the period when  
industrial productionwent up by over nine times,  
grain production did not even go up by one-fifth. This  
showed that the growth of agriculture was very lowas  
compared to industry. This was also the case within  
industry with heavy industry growing at a much faster  
speed than light industry. Mao, in his Critique of  
Soviet Economics, criticised this emphasis and  
called for simultaneous promotion of both industry  
as well as agriculture. Within industry he called for  
the development of both light and heavy industry  
at the same time.

Collectivisation of Agriculture: The first step in this  
process was taken in the NEP restoration period itself  
with the formation of the first co-operatives among  
small and medium peasants. However due to the  
resistance of the kulaks (rich farmers) there was not  
much progress. Further the kulaks had taken a  
position of active opposition and sabotage of the  
socialist construction process. They refused to sell to  
the Soviet State their grain surpluses. They resorted to  
terrorismagainst the collective farmers, against Party  
workers and government officials in the countryside,  
and burned down collective farms and state granaries.  
In 1927, due to this sabotage, the marketed share of  
the harvest was only 37%of the pre-war figure. Thus

the Party, in that year took the decision to launch an  
offensive to break the resistance of the kulaks. Relying  
on the poor peasants and allying with the middle  
peasants, the Party was able to achieve success in grain  
purchasing and take ahead the collectivisation process.  
However the major advance came fromthe end of

Prior to 1929, the Soviet Government had pursued  
a policy of restricting the kulaks. The effect of this  
policywas to arrest the growthof the kulakclass,  
some sections of which, unable to withstand the  
pressure of these restrictions, were forced out of  
business and ruined. But this policy did not destroy  
the economic foundations of the kulaks as a class, nor  
did it tend to eliminate them. This policy was essential  
up to a certain time, that is, as long as the collective  
farms and state farms were still weak and unable to  
replace the kulaks in the production of grain.

At the end of 1929, with the growth of the  
collective farms and the state farms, the Soviet  
Government turned sharply fromthis policy to the  
policy of eliminating the kulaks, of destroying  
themas a class. It withdrew the laws on the renting  
of land and the hiring of labour, thus depriving the  
kulaks both of land and of hired labourers. It lifted  
the ban on the confiscation of the kulaks’ property.  
It permitted the peasants to confiscate cattle,  
machines and other farmproperty fromthe kulaks  
for the benefit of the collective farms. The kulaks

thus lost all their means of production. They were  
expropriated just as the capitalists had been  
expropriated in the sphere of industry in 1918. The  
difference, however, was that the kulaks’ means of  
production did not pass into the hands of the state,  
but into the hands of the peasants, united in the  
collective farms.

A step-by-step plan was adopted for the  
implementation of this policy. Depending on the  
conditions in various regions, different rates of  
collectivisation were established and the targeted year  
for completion of the collectivisation was fixed. The  
production of tractors, harvesters and other  
agricultural machinery was increased manifold. State  
loans to collective farms were doubled in the first year  
itself. 25,000 class-conscious industrial workers were  
selected and sent to the rural areas to help implement  
this plan. The process of collectivisation despite some  
errors, advanced rapidly towards success. By 1934  
ninety percent of the total crop area of the country  
had been brought under socialist agriculture, i.e.  
state farms or collective farms.

The whole process of the collectivisation of  
agriculture was nothing less than a revolution in  
which the proletariat had allied with the poor and  
middle peasants to break the hold of the kulaks.

This revolution, at one blow, solved three  
fundamental problems of Socialist construction:

a) It eliminated the most numerous class of  
exploiters in the country, the kulak class, the  
mainstay of capitalist restoration;

b) It transferred the most numerous labouring class  
in the country, the peasant class, fromthe path of  
individual farming, which breeds capitalism, to the  
path of co-operative, collective, Socialist farming;

c) It furnished the Soviet regime with a Socialist  
base in agriculture—the most extensive and vitally  
necessary, yet least developed, branch of national  
economy.

With the victory of the collectivisation movement, the  
Party announced the victory of socialism. In January  
1933, Stalin announced that,“The victory of Socialism  
in all branches of the national economy had abolished  
the exploitation of man by man.”In January 1934, the  
17th Party Congress Report declared that, “the  
socialist formof social and economic structure—now  
holds undivided sway andis the sole commanding  
force in the whole national economy.”The absence of  
any antagonistic classes was later repeatedly stressed  
while presenting the Constitution in 1936 and in later  
Political Reports.

Errors in Russian Experience: The Russian  
experience in socialist construction was of central  
importance to the international proletariat, and  
particularly to all countries where the proletariat  
seized power. Stalin in his workEconomic Problems

of Socialism in the USSR tried to theorise  
regarding the process of socialist construction and  
the economic laws of socialism. He however did not  
make a self-critical analysis of the Russian experience.  
Later Mao made an analysis of the Russian experience  
and pointed certain errors in the practice, as well as in  
Stalin’s formulations.

Mao pointed out the following principal errors in  
the Russian experience: -

1.  Not giving due importance to the contradiction  
    betweenthe production relations and productive  
    forces. This was reflected in the prolonged coexistence  
    of two types of ownership – on the one hand  
    ownership of the whole people, as represented in the  
    nationalised industries and the stated farms and on the  
    other hand ownership by the collectives. Mao felt that  
    prolonged coexistence of ownership by the whole  
    people with ownership by the collectives was bound  
    to become less and less adaptable to the development  
    of the productive forces. Essentially a way had to be  
    found to make the transition fromcollective to public  
    ownership.
    
2.  Not giving importance to the mass-line during  
    socialist construction. Mao pointed out that in the  
    earlier period mass-line was adopted, but afterwards,  
    the Soviet party became less reliant on the masses. The  
    things emphasised were technology and technical  
    cadre, rather than politics and the masses.
    

3.  Neglecting the class struggle. After the success of  
    the collectivisation process not enough importance  
    was given to continuing the class struggle.
    
4.  Imbalance in the relation between heavy  
    industry on one side and light industry and  
    agriculture on the other.
    
5.  Mistrust of the peasants. Mao criticised the  
    Russian policy for not giving due importance to the  
    peasantry.
    

Besides drawing these lessons from Stalin and the  
Russian experience, Mao learnt from the Chinese  
experience. He thus made an at tempt to develope the  
Marxist theory of socialist construction.

Chapter 22

Fight against Trotskyismand Other Opportunist  
Trends

Throughout the period of the Russian Revolution and  
even after the seizure of power the Bolshevik line had  
to wage struggle against various opportunist  
lines. One of the most important of these anti-  
Marxist trends was Trotskyism, named after its  
originator, Leon Trotsky. Trotsky was a member of  
the RSDLP who at the time of the split between  
Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, sided with the  
Mensheviks. Later he tried to forma bloc separate  
fromboth the Bolshevik and Menshevik trends and  
evenpresented himself as the ‘centrist’who would  
unite the two groups. After the success of the  
February Revolution he self criticised for his errors  
and was admitted into the Bolshevik party and taken  
into the Central Committee. After the October  
Revolution he was Commissar of Foreign Affairs  
(1917-1918) and Commissar of Military and Naval  
Affairs (1918-1924) fromwhich post he was removed  
for his opportunist and factional activities.

In the period of socialist construction in particular,  
Trotskyismplayed a very disruptive and factional  
role. Stalin led the Party in a firmstruggle against  
Trotskyist opportunism. The three specific features  
of Trotskyism, which were outlined by Stalin, in  
his speech on Trotskyismor Leninism are:

1.  The theory of permanent revolution:

-   According to this theory, Trotsky proposed that  
    the proletariat should quickly move from the  
    bourgeois democratic stage to the socialist stage of  
    the revolution without the help of the peasantry.  
    He thus was opposed to any talk of dictatorship of  
    the proletariat and peasantry. He thus rejected the  
    role of the peasantry, the strongest ally of the  
    proletariat. This theory which looks very ‘Left’,  
    actually in essence meant the betrayal of the  
    revolution because without the peasantry there was  
    no hope of success for the proletariat and the  
    revolution was bound to end in failure. Another  
    aspect of this theory was that revolution in the  
    advanced capitalist countries was necessary for the  
    building of socialism. His theory of permanent  
    revolution was also a theory of world revolution,  
    which proposed that though revolution would start  
    on a national basis, the revolutionaries should  
    immediately work to spread it in other countries.  
    Again this proposal appears very ‘Left’ but actual  
    meant a very defeatist understanding that opposed  
    the possibility of building of socialism in one  
    country.

Lenin opposed this anti-Marxist theory as soon as it  
appeared in the period immediately following the 1905  
Revolution, when Trotsky was not part of the  
Bolshevik trend. However it appeared in various ways  
and had to be fought against at various points after the  
October Revolution, when Trotskyhad joined the

Bolshevik Party and become one of its leading  
members.

The first instance was immediately after the  
Revolution, during the negotiations for peace with  
Germany. Trotsky on the basis of his theory wanted  
war to continue as he felt that it would help the  
revolutionary situation in Germany and the success of  
the revolution in Germany, an advanced capitalist  
country was more important than the consolidation  
of the Russian Revolution. Lenin and Stalin forcefully  
opposed this argument, but a special Seventh Congress  
had to be held to discuss and defeat this  
understanding.

Another example of this theory was Trotsky’s  
Opposition’s fight against the introduction of the  
NEP (NewEconomic Policy). Being an opponent of  
the alliance with the peasantry, he felt that the NEP  
was nothing but a retreat. He did not accept the need  
of preserving this alliance and preparing the ground  
for socialist construction. Again this understanding  
had to be fought against and defeated at the Tenth  
Party Congress.

Athird example was at the time of turning fromthe  
NEP to Socialist Industrialisation. At that time  
Trotsky united with other elements to propose that it  
was not possible to build socialismin one country.  
This proposal based on Trotsky’s ‘permanent  
revolution’ and ‘world revolution’ understanding  
would have meant a defeatist and opportunist

approach towards socialist construction which would  
supposedly base the success of socialismin Russia on  
the success of revolutioninthe developed capitalist  
countries. Stalin united the Party against this  
understanding at the FourteenthPartyCongress in

2.  The second feature of Trotskyism is its  
    opposition to Bolshevik party principles. Trotsky’s  
    opposition to democratic centralism and the  
    concept of the Leninist party was apparent from  
    the very beginning in his support to the  
    Mensheviks during the split with the Bolsheviks.  
    Even later in 1912 he united all the opportunist trends  
    like the Liquidators and Recallists to forma faction  
    called the August bloc. While pretending to be a  
    ‘centrist’who was going to unite the Bolsheviks and  
    Mensheviks, Trotsky actually totally supported the  
    Mensheviks and was working jointly with them.  
    Lenin, supported by Stalin and others, opposed and  
    fought against this opportunist bloc.

In 1923, when Lenin was grievously ill, Trotsky  
took advantage of the gap in leadership to demand  
the withdrawal of all norms of democratic  
centralism in the party. He united all varied  
opposition elements to formulate a Declaration of  
the Forty-Six Oppositionists, which demanded  
freedomof factions and groups in the Communist  
Party. This factionalist demand was also defeated.

However Trotsky’s demand for ‘freedom’ and

‘democracy’ was totally opportunist and depended  
whether he was in a position of decision-making or  
not. Thus whenhe was at the centre of decision-  
making in 1920, Trotsky proposed the‘militarisation’  
of the trade unions and subjecting them to the  
discipline of the army. He opposed democracy being  
extended to the trade unions and the election of trade  
union bodies. Lenin, Stalin and other comrades led the  
struggle against this understanding and asserted that  
the trade unions shouldbase all their activities on  
methods of persuasion.

3.  The third feature of Trotskyismwas its repeated  
    false propaganda against the Bolshevik leadership.  
    In the initial period Trotsky concentrated all his  
    attacks on Lenin. In the later period Stalin became  
    the focus of all manner of defamation.

After Trotsky could not succeed in winning over the  
partyto his side inopen debate, he started secret  
manipulations. In 1926 he started a secret faction with  
an illegal press and secret propaganda. This was  
discovered and he was finally expelled fromthe Party.  
He movedabroad but continued tomaintainlinks  
with other factionalists within the Party. In 1929  
another group (the Right Opposition) was formed  
under the leadership of Bukharin, a Polit Bureau  
member, which opposed the fight against the kulaks  
and the advance of the process of collectivisation of  
agriculture. This line too was defeated.

In the thirties however Trotskyismceased to be a

political trend within the working class. It gave up  
attempts at open propagation of its anti-Marxist line  
but shifted to secret planning and manoeuvring.  
Trotsky and the top Trotskyists in the Soviet Union  
developed links with foreign intelligence services and  
started working on plans to assassinate leading  
elements in the Party and take over the leadership of  
the party. It was as part of this plan that Comrade  
Kirov, at that time second after Stalininthe Party  
leadership, was murdered in 1934. In the investigations  
that followed, the mainconspirators, many of who  
were Central Committee members, were discovered.  
Open trials were held where they admitted to their  
crimes. Many were sentenced to death and executed.

Tactics During World War II

During most of the period between World War I  
and World War II the world capitalist economy was  
in a state of collapse. World industrial production  
grewat a very slowpace and world trade remained  
stagnant. In fact the total world trade in 1948 (three  
years after the end of World War II) was the same as  
that in 1913 (the year before World War I started. The  
worst phase was what was called the Great Depression  
of 1929-33, from which capitalism did not really  
recover, even upto the start of World War II in 1939. It  
was a crisis that affected practically the whole world,  
fromthe most industrialised to the most backward.  
Industrial production fell and unemployment reached  
the highest levels ever. In Germany almost half the  
working class remainedunemployed. Prices crashed  
affecting the economies of almost every country.

As economic hardships increased, contradictions  
sharpened and there was widespread social and  
political unrest in many countries. In Latin America  
there were attempts to overthrowthe government in  
almost all the countries, many of which were  
successful. There was also an upsurge in the  
independence movements in many countries,  
including India. Thus throughout the colonies and  
semi-colonies there were struggles and a shift towards  
the left. In the imperialist countries, the ruling classes  
tried desperately to control the social effects of their

crisis. Some of themintroduced social welfare schemes  
to divert the masses fromstruggle. Most of the ruling  
classes however used repressive means to suppress  
the people. Many countries brought in rightist and  
fascist regimes. Italy was the first to turn to fascism.  
Japan shifted froma liberal toa national-militarist  
regime in 1930-31. Germanybrought the Nazis to  
power in1933. Inmany other imperialist countries  
also there was a rise of rightist parties and a retreat of  
the reformist parties.

The Communist International analysed this  
growth of fascism. It showed howthree factors in  
the post-World War I situationhad affected the  
imperialist classes and was leading to the rise of  
fascism. Firstly the success of the October  
Revolution and the victory of socialismhad made  
the bourgeoisie fearful of the advance of the  
proletariat and the success of the revolution in  
their own countries. Secondly they were facing the  
most severe economic crisis in the history of  
capitalism. Thirdly, the first two factors were  
making the toiling masses throughout the world  
turn towards revolution. The response of the  
imperialist ruling classes to all these three factors  
was to bring in fascism.

At the Seventh Congress of the Comintern, which was  
heldin 1935, fascismand the danger of war were  
analysed in detail. Fascismwas defined as the open,  
terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, the

most chauvinist and the most imperialist elements  
of finance capital. It was explained how the  
imperialists were planning to drastically increase the  
loot of the toiling masses. Theywere preparing to  
wage a newimperialist world war, to attack the Soviet  
Union, to divide up China among the imperialist  
powers, and thus to stop the advance of the  
revolution. As major imperialist countries started  
setting up fascist governments, they aggressively  
started local wars in preparation for a newworld war  
for the re-division of the world. As Germany and  
Japanstarted attacking and invading new areas, the  
other imperialist powers like Britain, France and the  
USAstarted a policy of compromise and concessions  
towards the fascist aggressors andattempted touse  
them todestroythe Soviet Republic. It was in the  
context of such dangerous tactics by the imperialists  
that the international proletariat had to work out and  
implement its tactics.

The tactics of the proletariat were directly opposed  
to the tactics of the imperialists. The aims of the  
international working class were the defence of the  
Soviet Union, the defeat of fascism and the  
instigators of war, the victory of the national  
liberation struggles and the establishment of Soviet  
power in as many countries as possible.

In order to achieve these aims the Third  
International adopted tactics as per Marxist  
principles of war tactics. As during the World War

I, the International called on all communists to try  
and prevent the outbreak of war and in case a war  
actually broke out, the International gave  
instructions that all communists should work to  
convert the unjust, imperialist war into civil war  
and thus complete the revolution. However the  
main difference from the World War I situation  
was that now there was a single socialist base – the  
Soviet Union. It was the duty of every communist  
to defend this socialist base. Thus in case the Soviet  
Red Army was forced to enter the war in the  
defence of the Soviet Union, then the nature of the  
war would change. It would become a just war for  
the defence of socialismand it would become the  
task of every communist to mobilise the workers  
and toiling masses of all countries for the victory of  
the Red Army over imperialism. Thus the  
Communist approach to the war and the tasks of  
the Communist Parties of the world was made clear  
in 1935 itself, four years before the actual outbreak  
of war.

The Third International further drewup detailed  
united front tactics in order to fight fascismand  
implement the above understanding. In the  
capitalist countries two types of fronts were to be  
formed. One was the anti-fascist workers’ fronts,  
whichwere to be formed along withthe Social-  
Democrat parties. The other was the anti-fascist  
people’s fronts, which were to be formedwhere  
necessary along with other anti-fascist parties

besides the Social-Democrats. In the colonies and  
semi-colonies, the task was to formanti-imperialist  
people’s fronts including the national bourgeoisie.  
The final aimof the communists in participating in  
all these fronts was to achieve the victory of  
revolution in their own country and the worldwide  
defeat of capitalism.

In the years leading up to the war most of the  
Communist Parties tried to implement the above  
tactics. United fronts were formed and movements  
developed in many countries. However during the  
various twists and turns in the situation, and in the  
differing concrete conditions in various countries,  
some of the parties were not successful in  
implementing the correct tactics.

The Soviet government however, which faced the  
most dangerous situation, was able, under Stalin, to  
employ the correct tactics in the concrete situation of  
World War II. In the pre-war years all attempts were  
made to build up a united front of the non-fascist  
governments against the group of fascist aggressor  
countries. However it soon became clear that these  
countries were not interested in a united front but  
were trying their best to use Germany to crush the  
Soviet Union. In order to defeat such tactics, Stalin  
entered into a no-war pact with Germany in  
August 1939, forcing the first part of the War to be  
a war between the imperialist powers. Thus  
Communist parties throughout the world worked

according to the tactics of ‘turning the war into  
civil war’ during the first two years of the war. The  
Soviet Union used this period to make all possible  
preparations for its defence in case any of the  
imperialist countries launched an attack.

This happened in June 1941, when Germany  
attacked the socialist base. With this attack the Red  
Army was forced to respond and the character of  
the war changed to that of an anti-fascist people’s  
war and the tactics as envisaged earlier by  
the Third International became applicable. Some of  
the parties, employing the correct tactics and  
making use of the severe revolutionary crisis, could  
achieve revolution. In particular, the Communist  
Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), was able to lead  
the Red Army and the whole Soviet people to a  
heroic victory in the war. It defeated the mighty  
German army and joined hands with the  
Communist parties and fighters of the East  
European countries to liberate themfromGerman  
occupation. Thus, utilising these tactics, the  
international proletariat not only succeeded in  
protecting its Socialist Base, but by 1949, could  
break the imperialist chain at several places, come  
out of the imperialist world system and build a  
Socialist Camp covering one third of humanity.  
Thus the strategy and tactics charted out by  
the Third International, during the period of  
Second World War were proved in practice to be  
basically correct.

However there were also serious failures. This was  
mainly due to incomplete education by the Third  
International leadership on the correct approach in  
implementing these tactics, and the strong  
remnants of the Second International reformist  
approach in many of the European parties and the  
parties formed by them—like the Communist Party  
of India. Parties like the CPI and the Communist  
Party of Great Britain spent most of its time in the  
people’s war period trying to increase production.  
Many such parties did a lot of strike breaking activity  
and got alienated fromthe working class. Some others  
like the Communist Party of France, who joined in  
united fronts with ruling class parties, did not even try  
to maintain any difference between communists and  
other reactionaries in the united front. Such an  
approach led to these parties becoming tails of the  
ruling classes in the united fronts that they  
participated in. It also led to the development of  
rightist tendencies, which in the following period  
would result in the leaderships of almost all these  
parties taking the path of revisionism.

The Third International, while not being able to  
combat these revisionist tendencies, had also lost its  
effectiveness in providing guidance inthe vastly  
differing conditions faced by the various member  
parties. Except for the regular publication of its  
periodicals, Comintern activityhadgreatly reduced  
from 1940 andeven the customaryMay Day and  
October Revolution Manifestos were discontinued

between May 1940 and May 1942. It was finally  
decided to dissolve the Comintern. Since a Congress  
could not be convened in the conditions of war the  
Presidium of the Executive Committee of the  
Communist International (ECCI) sent out a  
resolution recommending the dissolution of the  
International to all its sections. After receiving  
approval frommost of the sections, including all  
the important sections, the Comintern was  
dissolved on 10th June 1943.

Chapter 24

Mao’s Early Years

Mao Tse-tung was born on 26th December 1893, in  
the village of Shaoshan Chung in the fertile valley of  
Shaoshan in the Hunan province of China. The  
district where Mao was born was a wealthy  
agricultural area. It was also a strategic area with all  
major routes by road or river passing through the  
Hunan province. Being at the crossroads of commerce  
the Hunan people were known for their peasant  
traders. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth  
century Hunan also became an intellectual centre and  
a centre of dissidence and revolt, producing many of  
China’s best scholars. It produced both the military  
generals who helped the Chinese Emperors, as well as  
the revolutionaries who overthrewtheir rule. It was  
also a major centre of the biggest peasant revolt of the  
nineteenth century – the great Taiping peasant  
uprising. Hunan provided lakhs of fighters for the  
rebellion, which lasted for 14 years from1850 to 1864.  
This vast support for the peasant revolt was because of  
the severe poverty of the peasantry due to exploitation  
by the landlords and excessive taxation. Though the  
uprising had been brutally crushed, the memory of  
the revolt remained strong in the villages around  
where Mao spent his childhood and youth.

Mao’s father, Mao Jen-shen, was born a poor  
peasant and was forced to become a soldier for seven  
years in order to pay off his father’s debts. Later

through hard work and careful saving he was able to  
buy back his land. He grew to become a middle  
peasant and petty trader. The standard of living of the  
family however remained very poor. Even at the age  
of sixteen, Mao only ate one egg a month and meat  
about three or four times a month. Mao’s father put  
his children to work as soon as possible. Thus Mao  
started work in the fields at the age of six. Mao’s  
mother, Wen Chi-mei, was fromXiangxiang district  
just sixteen miles fromShaoshan. Mao was the eldest  
son. He had two younger brothers and an adopted  
sister. All three were among the members of the  
first peasant Communist party branch that Mao  
formed. All became martyrs in the Revolution.

Mao was a rebel froma very young age. He called  
his father the Ruling Power. He often united with his  
mother, brother and the labourer against the authority  
of his father. This was the opposition. At school too  
he opposed the old customs. Once in protest against  
his schoolteacher he, at the age of seven, ran away for  
three days and stayed in the mountains surrounding  
his village. After this protest–which Mao calls his  
first successful strike–he was not beaten in school.

Mao’s first school was the village primary school,  
which he joined at the age of seven. As soon as he  
learnt to read sufficiently, he developed a passion  
for reading. He preferred romantic books of rebellion  
and adventure. Very often he would read the whole  
night by the light of an oil lamp. Mao’s father, who

himself had very little schooling, was not interested in  
Mao continuing his education for too long. He needed  
somebody to work in the fields and to maintain his  
accounts. So in 1906, he removed Mao fromthe village  
school.

Maohowever continued his interest in reading and  
constantly demanded to be sent for further education.  
His father could not understand this interest of his son  
and thought the solution was in marriage. At the age  
of fourteen, Mao was married to a girl fromthe  
same area. Mao however refused to complete the  
marriage.

Meanwhile the revolutionary atmosphere was  
rapidly growing in the surrounding areas. Two  
rebellions took place in this period, which had a  
lasting impact on Mao. One was the revolt in Hunan  
in 1906 led by the revolutionaries of the party of the  
nationalist Sun Yat-sen. The other was a rebellion  
against a landlord by a group of peasants of Shaoshan  
itself. Both were crushed and the leaders were  
beheaded. Mao was very much affected by the  
injustice and longed to do something radical for the  
country and its people. He also longed to continue his  
education. Finally in 1910, he was sent to a Higher  
Primary School, in his mother’s home district,  
Xiangxiang.

The students in this school were all fromlandlord  
and rich background who initially looked down  
upon Mao. Mao however had soon outshone all the

other students by his superior intellect and hard  
work and study. He would sit reading for long hours  
in the classroomafter everyone had left. His teachers  
were highly impressed byhis ability. Withina few  
months however he was restless to move on to a  
higher level. After a year he easily passed the exams  
for admission to Middle School which was situated  
in Changsha, the provincial capital of Hunan. In  
September 1911, Mao walked the forty miles to  
Changsha. Mao, who was almost eighteen, was seeing  
a city for the first time.

Changsha, a city of scholars, was in extreme  
turmoil at the time of Mao’s arrival there.  
Revolutionary associations under various names  
had been formed by teachers and students.  
Underground literature was being circulated and  
an explosion was expected at any moment. Mao,  
who had already developed some radical thinking,  
was eager to participate inthe events. Within a  
month of Mao’s arrival the 1911 bourgeois  
revolution broke out under the leadership of Sun  
Yat-sen. Mao immediately decided to join the  
revolutionary army. The revolution however was  
soonbetrayed andlanded inthe hands of counter  
revolutionaries. Mao, after five months, resigned from  
the army and landed back in Changsha.

On his return, Mao was in search of what to do and  
what direction to take in life. Looking up  
advertisements in newspapers, he registered for a

number of courses inschools ranging from a soap-  
making school and a police school to a lawschool and  
a commercial school. He finally sat for the entrance  
examination for the First Provincial Middle School  
in Changsha and stood first. After six months  
however he left the school and arranged a schedule  
of education of his own, which consisted of reading  
every day at the Hunan Provincial Library. For six  
months, he would spend the whole day from  
morning to night at the library with just a small  
lunch of two rice cakes. This period of intensive  
reading covered a very wide range of social and  
scientific topics of Western as well as Chinese  
authors. It laid the foundation of Mao’s  
education. Six months of suchstudy however left  
Mao totally penniless. His father, who could not  
understand his son’s desire to just go on reading on his  
own, refused to support himunless he joined a real  
school.

Thus in 1913, Mao joined the Hunan First Normal  
College which was a Teachers’ College. He  
remained there for five years from 1913 to

1918.  The collapse of the central Chinese government  
    and the outbreak of World War I had created  
    conditions of extreme upheaval throughout China and  
    the world. In China wars between provincial armies of  
    warlord generals became a common occurrence. It was  
    also the period when Japan, making use of the  
    involvement of the other imperialist powers in war,  
    tried to achieve total domination over China. This led

to strong opposition fromChinese intellectuals and  
revolutionary sections.

It was during these years that Mao’s political ideas  
took shape. In 1915 he became secretary of the  
Students’ Society at the Normal College, and  
created the Association for Student Self-  
Government. This organisation organised numerous  
agitations against the college authorities for student  
demands. Mao also led this organisation in street  
demonstrations against Japanese domination and their  
Chinese puppets. This organisation was later to  
become the nucleus for future student  
organisations in the Hunan province.

As the attacks of the warlord generals grew the  
students in many places formed self-defence corps.  
In 1917 Mao became the head of his college  
battalion. He obtained some arms fromthe local  
police and led the students in guerrilla attacks on  
warlord groups to collect more arms. Usinghis  
knowledge of guerrilla tactics used by earlier  
Hunanese fighters as well as study of military  
theory, Mao build up the college battalion into an  
efficient fighting force. Mao also took a keen  
interest in all the major military campaigns of the  
ongoing World War I. He lectured and wrote  
articles on strategy and tactics.

Mao also involved himself in various other activities.  
He fought against social evils like opiumtaking and  
prostitution. He fought against oppression of women

and tried to ensure the maximumparticipation of  
women in the students’ movement. He wrote and  
encouraged swimming, sports and intensive physical  
training among the students and youth. He himself  
maintained extreme physical fitness–took cold baths  
throughout the year, swam in cold water, went  
barefoot and bare-chested for long walks in the hills,  
etc. In 1917 he started an evening school where he and  
other students and teachers taught the workers of  
Changsha’s factories free of charge.

In 1918, Mao inaugurated the NewPeople’s Study  
Society, which he had been planning for about a  
year. It was one of many such student groups, but  
grewinto something else, the core of a political  
party. Fromthe start it insisted on action as well as  
debate. It would not only talk revolution, but  
practise it, first of all revolutionising its own  
members, turning theminto‘newmen’. It had girl  
members and took up among other issues, the  
oppression of women in the traditional marriage  
system. Its activities went according to a  
programme of debate, study and social  
action. Social action included night schools for  
workers, visiting factories, demonstrating against  
Japanese imperialism, writing articles, fighting for  
newideas and the use of the vernacular language. In  
later years all thirteen of the original members of  
the society joined the Communist Party of China  
(CPC), founded in 1921. By 1919 there were eighty  
members, of whom over forty were to join the

Party.

Around the time of Mao’s graduation from the  
Normal College in 1918 he was joined in Changsha by  
his mother who came there for treatment. She  
however could not be cured and died in October 1918.  
After her death Mao moved to Peking, the capital of  
China, where he for six months took up a very low  
paying job as an assistant librarian in the Peking  
University. This job was obtained through Li Ta-chao  
the universitylibrarian, who was the first Chinese  
intellectual to praise the Russian Revolution and one  
of the first to introduce Marxist thought to  
China. Under Li Ta-chao, Mao rapidly developed  
towards Marxism. He started reading those works  
of Lenin, which had been translated into Chinese.  
Towards the end of 1918 he joined the Marxist  
Study Group formed by Li. He also met many  
intellectuals and Marxists. One who had an impact  
then on himwas Chen Tu-hsiu, who was later to  
become the first Secretary of the CPC. Chen at that  
time was editor of the radical magazine, New  
Youth, which Mao had already written for and which  
had had an influence on him.

Mao spent only six months inPeking. During this  
period however he fell in love with Yang Kai-hui,  
the daughter of one of his Changsha College  
lecturers, who was now a Professor at the Peking  
University. She was then a student, doing a course in  
journalismat the university. For both it was their first

love. Their love was of the type that was then called  
‘new’love where the partners made their own choice  
going against the traditional system of arranged  
marriages. For some time their love remained secret.  
They were not sure whether there was time for love  
when the country needed them so much. They  
decided to wait some time before taking a final  
decision.

In April 1919 Mao returned to Changsha just before  
the outbreakof the historic May 4th movement of

1919.  This anti-imperialist democratic movement  
    shook the whole of China. Though initiated by the  
    students, it rapidly covered vast sections of workers,  
    merchants, shopkeepers, artisans and other  
    sections. Mao immediately involved himself  
    wholeheartedly in political agitation. On his  
    arrival he had immediately taken up a lowpaying  
    job as a primary school teacher. All his spare time  
    however was spent in organising agitations and  
    spreading Marxism. He encouraged the study of  
    Marxismin the NewPeople’s Study Society and other  
    students’societies that he was in contact with. At the  
    same time he built up the United Students Association  
    of Hunan which encompassed even young school  
    students and girls students in a big way. Uniting all  
    sections Mao organised a movement for the seizure  
    and burning of Japanese goods. He brought out a  
    weekly magazine the Xiang River Review, which  
    quickly had a great influence on the students  
    movement in South China. When the weekly was

banned in October 1919, Mao continued to write in  
other journals. Soon he got a job as a journalist for  
various Hunan papers and set out for the big cities  
of Wuhan, Peking and Shanghai to win support for  
the Hunan movement.

However whenhe landed in Peking in February  
1920, he soon got involved with the plans to build  
the Communist Party of China. He held discussions  
with his universitylibrarian, Li Ta-chao andother  
intellectuals. He visited the factories and railway yards  
and discussed Marxism with the workers. He did  
further study of the works of Marx and Engels and  
other socialists. He also met Yang Kai-hui, who had  
been studying Marxism. They discussed their  
dedication to each other and to the revolution.  
They got engaged.

After Peking, Mao spent four months in Shanghai,  
China’s biggest city and its biggest industrial and  
commercial centre. Here he held discussions with  
Chen Tu-hsiu and other Shanghai Marxists. To  
support himself he took a job as a labourer,  
working twelve to fourteen hours in a laundry. It  
was during this period, in May 1920, that China’s first  
Communist group was set up in Shanghai.

When Mao moved backed to Hunan in July 1920,  
he started working to set up a similar Communist  
group there. His father had died in the beginning of  
the year and Mao made his home in Shaoshan there  
initially. His two brothers and adopted sister were

among his first recruits. He then moved back to  
Changsha where he continued recruiting. There he  
took up a job as the director of a primary school  
and also taught one class at the Normal College for  
which he received a comfortable salary for the first  
time.

Towards the end of 1920, Mao got married to Yang  
Kai-hui and they lived together for the one and a  
half years that Mao was in Changsha as primary  
school director. They were regarded as an ideal  
couple with Yang being also involved with the  
work of the Party of which she became a member  
in 1922. They had two sons, one of whomdied in  
1950 as a volunteer in the Korean War against US  
imperialism. The other became an accountant.  
Yang who performed secret work for the Party was  
arrested in 1930 and executed.

Though Mao participated in various agitations  
during this period, the main focus of his work was  
the formation and building up of the CPC. After  
forming a Communist group in Hunan, Mao went  
to Shanghai to attend the secretly held First  
National Congress of the CPC in July 1921. He was  
one of twelve delegates who represented only 57 party  
members at that time.

After the Congress, Mao became the Provincial  
Party Secretary of Hunan Province. Fromthe very  
beginning he paid particular attention of building the  
party in Hunan on the basis of Leninist party

principles. He recruited youth from the existing  
revolutionary organisations as well as advanced  
workers whowere won by extending the workers’  
movement. He started two monthly magazines to  
raise the ideological and political level of the Party  
members and Youth League members and tohelp  
themto carry on Communist education among the  
masses.

It was during this period upto 1923 that Mao  
concentrated a great deal on the organising of  
workers in Changsha, the Anyuan Colliery (in the  
neighbouring Kiangsi Province) and in the  
Shuikoushan Lead Mine. By August 1921 he set up  
the first Communist trade union. In 1922 he formed  
the Hunan branch of the All-China Labour  
Federation, of which he was made the chairman. The  
Anyuan Colliery movement and organisation in  
particular was an excellent example of Communist  
organising. The Party at first ran spare-time schools  
for the workers of the colliery to carry on Marxist  
education. It then organised a trade union. Meanwhile,  
a branchof the Socialist Youth League was formed  
among the workers, the best members of which were  
later absorbed into the Party. The Anyuan Colliery  
saw major strikes, which had country wide  
repercussions. It had a strong organisation, which  
survived even during the repression periods. The  
workers provided valuable support and participation  
at various stages in the revolutionary war. Anyuan was  
the liaison centre for the first Communist base area in

the Chingkang Mountains.

Mao did not participate in the Second National  
Congress of the CPC, held in July 1922, as he missed  
his appointment. He participated in the Third  
National Congress of the CPC, held in June 1923,  
at which he was elected on the Central  
Committee. This Congress decided to promote an  
anti-imperialist, anti-feudal national front in co-  
operation with the Kuomintang Party led by Sun  
Yat-sen. It directed Communist Party members to  
join the Kuomintang Party as individuals. Mao did  
so and was elected as an alternate member of the  
Kuomintang Central Executive Committee at its  
First and Second National Congresses held in 1924  
and 1926. He worked as Head of the Central  
Propaganda department of the Kuomintang, edited  
the Political Weekly and directed the Sixth class at  
the Peasant Movement Institute.

the beginning of 1926 the Chinese Revolution  
advanced rapidly with the proletariat and peasantry in  
great ferment. In 1925 the protest against the  
30th May massacre of demonstrators by the British  
police in Shanghai turned into an anti-imperialist  
people’s movement involved all sections of the masses  
throughout the country. The country was on the  
verge of a decisive battle between revolution and  
counter-revolution.

However two deviations then plagued the CPC. The  
dominant Right opportunist clique was led by the  
then party General Secretary, ChenTu-hsiu. He  
took the stand that the bourgeois-democratic  
revolution must be led by the bourgeoisie and the  
aimof the revolution should be to forma bourgeois  
republic. According to his line the bourgeoisie was the  
only democratic force with which the working class  
should unite. He did not consider any possibility of  
building an alliance with the peasantry. On the  
other hand, were the ‘Left’ opportunists who were  
represented by Chang Kuo-tao, the leader of the  
All-China Federation of Labour. He sawonly the  
working-class movement. He argued that the  
working class is strong enough to make revolution  
alone. Thus his clique also ignored the peasantry.

While fighting these two deviations, Mao made his  
first major contributions to the development of  
Marxist theory.InMarch 1926, he brought out his  
famous Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society and  
in March 1927, he presented his Report on an  
Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan. In  
these works he tried to answer the most basic  
questions of the Chinese revolution. Who are the  
friends and enemies of the revolution, who is the  
leading force and who are the reliable and vacillating  
allies? He argued that it was the proletariat and not  
the bourgeoisie who would have to lead the  
revolution. However the proletariat would not be  
able to win by fighting alone. He stressed the role  
of the peasantry, which was the closest and most  
numerous ally of the proletariat. He also pointed  
out that the national bourgeoisie was a vacillating  
ally with the possibility of the Right wing  
becoming an enemy and the Left wing remaining a  
friend of the revolution. Mao also presented his  
ideas on howthe masses were to be mobilised, a  
revolutionary government established and the  
peasant armed forces organised. This was Mao’s  
clear perspective for the direction the revolutionary  
forces should take.

This was the time of the Northern Expedition,  
which was a critical part of the first phase of the  
Chinese Revolution – the First Revolutionary Civil  
War. It was a march by the Revolutionary Army  
under the leadership of the revolutionary national

united front (the Kuomintang-CPCunited front).  
Starting in July 1926 fromKwantung in the south  
of China its aim was to smash the reactionary  
government of the imperialist-backed Northern  
warlords in a revolutionary war and achieve the  
independence and unity of China. The Northern  
Expedition was initially a major success with the  
whole of South China and many of the Southern  
warlords being defeated or won over. Under the  
influence of the Northern Expeditionthere was an  
upsurge among the peasantry. The proletariat staged  
many armed uprisings in cities to coincide with the  
advance of the Revolutionary Army. Even Shanghai  
the largest industrial and commercial city of China  
was liberated in March 1927 after three attempts at  
armed workers’uprising.

After achieving major victories however the bourgeois  
clique represented by Chiang Kai-shek (the main  
Kuomintang leader after Sun Yat-sen’s death in 1925),  
broke the united front. In April 1927 massacres,  
backed by the imperialists, were launched on the  
Communist cadre in various parts of the country. The  
Right opportunist Chen Tu-hsiu leadership of the  
CPChowever, instead of mobilising the workers and  
peasants against the Kuomintang reactionaries,  
submitted to them. In July 1927 another Kuomintang  
clique launched massacres against the Communists.  
This resulted in the breaking up of the united front  
and defeat of the First Revolutionary Civil War.

The Right line of Chen Tu-hsiu, which dominated  
throughout the period of the First Revolutionary  
Civil War was one the important reasons for the  
failure of the revolution during this period.  
Though Mao struggled against this Right Line, he  
could not win the support of the majority in the  
Party. In fact at the Fifth National Congress held  
during this period, in April 1927, Chen succeeded  
in removing Mao fromthe Central Committee.

The Second Revolutionary Civil War Period : In  
August 1927, at the start of the next period—the  
Second Revolutionary Civil War Period—Chen Tu-  
hsiu was removed as General Secretary after a firm  
criticism of his Right opportunism. Mao was  
brought back on the Central Committee and made  
an alternate member of the Provisional Polit  
Bureau that was set up. However the correct  
criticismof the Right line gave way in November  
1927 to the domination of a ‘Left’ line in the  
Central Committee, under the leadership of Chu  
Chiu-pai, an intellectual comrade returned after  
training in Russia. This line made the wrong  
assessment that the Chinese revolution was on a  
‘continuous upsurge’, and therefore called for  
armed uprisings in many cities. The leadership  
criticised Mao for advocating and leading a peasant  
uprising and opposing uprisings in big cities. He  
was again removed fromhis Central posts. He was  
also removed from membership of the Hunan  
Provincial Committee. The ‘Left’ Line led to heavy

losses and the abandonment of this line by April

The Sixth Congress of the CPC held in Moscow in  
June 1928 rectified this first ‘Left’ line and adopted  
a basically correct understanding, repudiating both  
the Right and ‘Left’ positions. Though Mao did not  
attend the Congress it basically upheld his position  
on many points. In his absence he was again elected  
on to the Central Committee. It was while  
implementing this understanding, and while building  
up the Red Army after the failures of the Northern  
Expedition and the city uprisings, that Mao made his  
further contributions to the development of Marxist-  
Leninist theory. He wrote Why is it that Red  
Political Power can exist in China? in October  
1928, and The Struggle in the Chingkang  
Mountains in November 1928. These historical  
works provided the theoretical basis for the historic  
process of building and developing the Red Army  
then under way. Mao, starting froma small group  
of worker and peasant fighters had after the failure  
of the peasant uprising in 1927 set up the first base  
in the Chingkang mountains in October 1927.  
Throughthe period from1927 to the beginning of  
1930 the area of armed peasant uprisings and rural  
revolutionary bases grew steadily. Many of the  
fighting sections under Communist leadership joined  
Mao’s forces. The Red Army grewto 60,000 soldiers  
and, a little later to 1,00,000 soldiers.

However ‘left’ ideas again started gaining  
ascendancy and from1930 took over the leadership  
of the party. Two ‘Left’ lines led by Li Li-san in  
1930 and Wang Ming in 1931-34 dominated the  
party and caused incalculable harm. Li Li-san in  
June 1930 drew up a plan for organising armed  
uprisings in the major cities throughout the  
country and for concentrating all the units of the  
Red Army for attacking these major cities. The  
attempt to implement this plan between June and  
September 1930 led tosevere losses and a demand  
fromcadres for its rectification. During this period  
Mao led an attack on Changsha but withdrew to  
prevent heavy losses in the face of superior imperialist  
and Kuomintang forces. After the withdrawal there  
was brutal repression in Changsha during which Yang  
Kai-hui, Mao’s wife, who was doing underground  
work there, was executed. Li Li-san did self-  
criticismat a plenumheld in September 1930 and  
stepped down fromleadership positions. Mao and  
Chu Teh (Commander of the Red Army) were  
taken on to the newly formed Polit Bureau.

This Polit Bureau was however bypassed by a plenum  
calledin January 1931 by Wang Ming one of the  
group of twenty-eight so-called‘Bolsheviks’who had  
returned after training inRussia. They did not call  
Mao and Chu Teh for the plenumbut removed them  
and others fromthe Central Committee. In August  
1932 Mao was also removed from his posts as  
secretary of the Front Committee and political

commissar of the Red Army. Withthe Party and  
Red Army in their full control the Wang Ming clique  
committed numerous errors which led to severe losses.  
Throughout, their main attack was on Mao, who was  
the representative of what was according to themright  
opportunismand the main danger within the Party.  
Mao’s correct line was called a ‘rich peasant line’.  
Sectarian and factional methods were used by the  
‘Left’Line leadership to attack not only Mao but also  
the leaders of the earlier‘Left’Lines, Li Li-san and  
Chu Chiu-pai. While the Wang Ming clique was  
creating havoc in the Party, Chiang Kai-shek was  
organising repeated campaigns of encirclement and  
suppression against the Red base areas. The first four  
campaigns were defeated because of Mao’s leadership  
and the influence of his strategic principles before the  
‘Left’leadership acquired full control over the Party  
and Red Army in the base areas. However when the  
‘Left’ leadership actually moved into the base area  
their direct leadership led to serious errors and  
defeat of the Communist forces in the fifth  
campaign of the Kuomintang forces. In order to  
break through Chiang Kai-shek’s encirclement and  
win new victories it was decided from October  
1934, to undertake the world-shaking strategic shift  
of the Red Army, known as the Long March. Mao  
was accompanied by his next wife, Ho Tzu-chen, a  
Party cadre froma local peasant family of the Kiangsi  
base area. They had married in 1931, after the death of  
Mao’s earlier wife, Yang Kai-hui. They had two

children who were left behind with peasants in the  
Kiangsi base area at the start of the Long March.

It was during the Long March, at the Tsunyi  
Plenum of the CPC, in January 1935, that  
leadership of the party moved into the hands of  
Mao and his policies. This was a turning point for  
the Long March as well as for the Chinese  
Revolution. It was then decided to continue the Long  
March in the northward direction to be able to better  
co-ordinate the nation-wide anti-Japanese movement,  
which had been growing continuously since the  
Japanese attack and occupation of North-eastern  
China in 1931.

During the Long March, besides the repeated  
attacks of the Kuomintang troops, the Party had  
also to face the line of flightismand warlordismled  
by Chang Kuo-tao. Two conferences of the Central  
Committee held during the Long March defeated  
Chang Kuo-tao’s proposal to retreat to national  
minority areas of Sinkiang andTibet. He however  
refused to followthe Party decision and tried to form  
a new Party Centre. He led a section of the Red Army  
in a different direction during which they were  
attacked and finished off by the Kuomintang forces.  
Chang himself became a traitor and joined the  
Kuomintang. The main force of the Red Army  
reachedtheir destination in the Shensi province in  
Northern China in October 1935, one year after they  
had started the Long March. The Red Army which

numbered around 3,00,000 just before the beginning  
of the fifth encirclement campaign had now been  
reduced to just over twenty thousand. It was this core  
that set up the Shensi-Kansu-Ninghshia (on the border  
areas of these three provinces of Northern China) base  
area. It became famously known as Yenan, the name  
of its capital. This was the base fromwhich Mao led  
the Party and Red Army to victory by 1945 in the war  
against Japan.

It was during this period that Mao and Ho Tzu-chen  
were divorced in 1938. In April 1939 he married  
Chiang Ching. Chiang Ching was the party name of  
Lan Ping, a theatre and filmactress, who had joined  
the Party in 1933 and moved to Yenan in1937 to teach  
drama at the Art Academy there and participate in the  
propaganda teams who went among the peasantry.  
Mao who took a keen interest in art and literature met  
her in the course of this work and they fell in love and  
decided to get married.

The Period of the War of Resistance Against  
Japan: Immediately after the completion of the Long  
March, Mao concentrated on the adoption and  
implementation of a newtactical orientation in order  
to end the Civil War and unite the maximumforces  
for a War of Resistance against Japan. His presentation  
On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism was a major  
development of Marxist-Leninist United Front tactics.  
This was later further developed inhis May 1937  
Report on The Tasks of the Chinese Communist

Party in the Period of Resistance to Japan. Giving a  
brilliant exposition of the stage of development of  
China’s internal and external contradictions, Mao  
explained the change in the principal contradiction  
caused by Japan’s aggression and therefore the  
change in the United Front tactics necessary to face  
the new situation. He called for a united front with  
the Kuomintang in order to drive away the  
Japanese aggressors. Chiang Kai-shekhowever did  
not agree to enter a united front until he was forced to  
do so by the CPC’s propaganda and by the pressure of  
certain factions in his own party. He finally agreed,  
when he was arrested in December 1936 by two of his  
own generals who insisted that a united front should  
be built with the CPC. The Anti-Japanese United  
Front was set up in August 1937.

During the period of the War of Resistance, Mao  
had again to fight wrong trends though these did  
not growto capture leadership over the Party and  
the struggle. One was a pessimistic trend of  
national subjugation present insome Kuomintang  
sections of the United Front. These people after some  
defeats at the hands of the Japanese felt that the  
Chinese was bound to be suppressed and ruled by the  
Japanese and other imperialists. One faction even  
prepared for surrender. On the other hand there was  
the trend in some sections of the CPC, who felt  
that since the united front had been formed there  
would be quick victory over the Japanese. These  
comrades overestimated the strength of the United

Front and did not see the reactionaryside of the  
Chiang Kai-shek clique. In order to correct these  
mistaken theories and to point out the correct course  
of the war, Mao in May 1938 brought out his  
book On Protracted War which pointed out that the  
War would finally end in victorybut the victory  
would not be quick. He also in this and other writings  
laid down the military principles of the war.

Mao also wrote various philosophical works to help  
educate the Party cadre and remove the damaging  
effects of the earlier Right and‘Left’Lines. Basing on  
these writings, between 1941 and 1944, a  
lengthy Rectification Campaign was held to fight the  
main errors in the Party. This was combined with in-  
depth discussions to reviewthe history of the Party.  
Chou En-lai, who had been a leading comrade  
throughout the period, particularly participated in this  
process. This led finally to an open and complete  
repudiation of the earlier wrong Lines. This  
understanding was adopted in the Resolution on  
Certain Questions in the Historyof Our Party at  
Plenumof the CPC held in April 1945.

Armed with the correct line and correct tactics, the  
CPCled the Chinese people to victory, first in the  
War of Resistance against Japan and then against the  
reactionaries led by Chiang Kai-shek. Froma fighting  
force of just over twenty thousand at the end of the  
Long March, the Red Army grewto a strength of one  
million towards the end of the anti-Japanese war in

1945.  At that time, at the Seventh Congress of the  
    CPC in April 1945, Mao in his Report On  
    Coalition Government, presented a detailed  
    summing up of the anti-Japanese war and an  
    analysis of the current international and domestic  
    situation. He gave a specific programme for the  
    formation of a coalition government with the  
    Kuomintang after the victory over the Japanese  
    forces.

The Third Revolutionary Civil War  
Period: However after the victory over the Japanese,  
Chiang Kai-shek, because of the support of U.S.  
imperialismand the superior strength of his military  
forces, refused to agree to the formation of a coalition  
government onanyreasonable terms. At that time  
even Stalin wanted the CPC to come to an agreement,  
saying that they should not have a civil war and  
should co-operate withChiang Kai-shek, otherwise  
the Chinese nation would perish. Nevertheless the  
CPCunder Mao went ahead and fought what came to  
be known as the Third Revolutionary Civil War.  
Relying on the full support of the masses and  
particularly the peasantry, the Red Army was able to  
change the military balance of forces and move in  
July 1947 from the strategic defensive to the  
strategic offensive. By October 1949 the CPChad,  
within a period of four years, won nation-wide  
victory over the U.S. backed Kuomintang.

As China gained victory, Marxist-Leninists andthe

proletariat throughout the world were filled with joy  
and pride at the formation of a seemingly invincible  
socialist campencompassing one-third of humanity.  
Mao however gave an idea of the challenges ahead and  
dangers of the coming period. In 1949, on the  
occasion of the twenty-eighth anniversary of the  
founding of the CPC, in his speech‘On the People’s  
Democratic Dictatorship’, he said, "Twenty- eight  
years of our Party are a long period, in which we have  
accomplished only one thing—we have won basic  
victory in the revolutionary war. This calls for  
celebration, because it is the people’s victory, because  
it is a victory in a country as large as China. But we  
still have much work to do; to use the analogy of a  
journey, our past work is only the first step in a long  
march of ten thousand."

Chapter 26

The Path of Revolution for the Colonies and Semi-  
Colonies

Immediately after the establishment of the Chinese  
Peoples’ Republic the international communist  
movement gave open recognition to the significance of  
the Chinese path of revolution, for the colonies and  
semi-colonies. In the 27 January, 1950, editorial of  
For a Lasting Peace, For a People’s Democracy, the  
organ of the Cominform, it was stated, “The path  
taken by the Chinese people... is the path that  
should be taken by the people of many colonial and  
dependent countries in their struggle for national  
independence and people’s democracy.

“The experience of the victorious national-liberation  
struggle of the Chinese people teaches that the  
working class must unite with all classes, parties,  
groups and organisations willing to fight the  
imperialists and their hirelings and to forma broad,  
nation-wide united front, headed by the working class  
and its vanguard—the communist party...

“Adecisive condition for the victorious outcome of  
the national-liberation struggle is the formation, when  
the necessary internal conditions allow for it, of  
people’s liberation armies under the leadership of the  
communist party.”

Thus, the universal applicability of Marxist-Leninist  
theory developed by Mao—i.e. Maoism—was

recognised, andbegan to become the guideline for  
genuine revolutionaries throughout the world,  
particularly in the colonies and semi-colonies.

Mao’s formulation of the Chinese Path of Revolution  
had been developed in his numerous writings during  
the advance of the Revolution. Lenin had already  
pointed out that in the era of imperialism and  
proletarian revolution it was the proletariat and not  
the bourgeoisie that would lead the bourgeois  
democratic revolution. Mao in his work On New  
Democracy, carrying this understanding ahead,  
further pointed out that in this era, any revolution  
in a colony or semi-colony that is directed against  
imperialism, no longer comes within the old  
category of the bourgeois-democratic world  
revolution, but within a new category; it is no  
longer part of the old bourgeois, or capitalist,  
world revolution, but is part of the new world  
revolution, the proletarian-socialist world  
revolution. Such revolutionary colonies and semi-  
colonies can no longer be regarded as allies of the  
counter-revolutionary front of world capitalism;  
they have become allies of the revolutionary front  
of world socialism. Thus, in order to differentiate  
fromthe old bourgeois democratic revolution, he  
called the revolution in the colonies and semi-  
colonies a New Democratic Revolution. Onthis  
basis he elaborated the politics, economy and culture  
of New Democracy.

Mao also developed on the understanding of the  
united front that Lenin and Stalin had given. He  
showed that the bourgeoisie in the colonies and semi-  
colonies was divided into two parts–the comprador  
bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. The  
comprador bourgeoisie, who depended on imperialism  
for its existence and growth, was always an enemy of  
the revolution. The national bourgeoisie was a  
vacillating ally who would sometimes help the  
revolution and sometimes join the enemies. Thus the  
united front under the leadership of the proletariat  
would consist of a four class alliance – the  
proletariat, the peasantry, the urban petty  
bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. The  
enemies of the revolution were imperialism, the  
comprador bourgeoisie and the landlords.

According to Mao the revolution in the colonies and  
semi-colonies would not follow the path of  
insurrection followed by the Russian Revolution  
where the maincities were captured first and then  
control taken over the countryside. He showed the  
Chinese path of protracted people’s war which  
involved the areawise seizure of power in the  
countryside, the building of guerrilla zones and  
base areas and the final encircling and capturing of  
the cities. To achieve this Mao laid down the military  
principles of revolutionary war. He taught howto  
build up the RedArmy, which was an absolutely  
necessary weapon of the revolution. Starting from  
guerrilla warfare and then moving to mobile warfare

and finally to positional warfare, Mao showed the way  
howa small force can rely on the vast masses to build  
up the forces needed to defeat a formidable enemy.

Finally, basing himself on the Marxist-Leninist  
understanding of the state and the dictatorship of the  
proletariat, Mao elaborated the theory regarding the  
formof the state inthe revolutions inthe colonial  
countries. On the basis of the theory of New  
Democracy, he formulated the understanding of  
the new- democratic republic.

This new-democratic republic he said would be  
different from the oldEuropean-Americanformof  
capitalist republic under bourgeois dictatorship which  
is the old democratic formand already out of date. On  
the other hand, it would also be different fromthe  
socialist republic of the Soviet type under the  
dictatorship of the proletariat. For a certain historical  
period, this form too was not suitable for the  
revolutions in the colonial and semi-colonial  
countries. During this period, therefore, a third form  
of state was necessary to be adopted in the revolutions  
of all colonial and semi-colonial countries, namely, the  
new-democratic republic under the joint  
dictatorship of several anti-imperialist classes. Since  
this formsuits a certain historical period it is therefore  
transitional. Nevertheless, according toMao, it is a  
formthat is necessary and cannot be dispensed with.

This state was established after the victory of the  
Chinese Revolution in the form of the People’s

Democratic Dictatorship. Mao explained the  
essence of the people’s democratic dictatorship as  
the combination of two aspects – democracy for the  
people and dictatorship over the reactionaries. The  
people are the working class, the peasantry, the urban  
petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. These  
classes, led by the working class and the Communist  
Party, unite to formtheir own state and elect their  
own government; they enforce their dictatorship over  
the running dogs of imperialism—the landlord class  
and bureaucrat-bourgeoisie, as well as the  
representatives of those classes.

Mao further pointed out that the Communist Party  
had to lead the process of transformation of the  
People’s Democratic Dictatorship into a Socialist  
State. The people’s democratic dictatorship, led by the  
proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance,  
required that the Communist Party should unite the  
entire working class, the entire peasantry and the  
broad masses of revolutionary intellectuals; these are  
the leading and basic forces of the dictatorship.  
Without this unity, the dictatorship cannot be  
consolidated. It is also required that the Party unite  
with as many as possible of the representatives of the  
urban petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie who  
were ready to co-operate and with their intellectuals  
and political groups. This was necessary to isolate the  
counter-revolutionary forces. If this were done it  
would be possible, after the victory of the revolution,  
to speedily restore and develop production, cope with

foreign imperialism, steadily transform a backward  
semi-colonial agricultural economy into an industrial  
country and build up a socialist state.

Chapter 27

Mao on Philosophy

Mao’s writings on philosophy are directed to  
educating the Partycadre and masses in Marxism-  
Leninismso as to change the mode of thinking and  
practice. Mao himself was an ardent student of  
philosophy. When he got hold of books on  
philosophy he would consume them in intense  
concentrated reading. Because of the earlier influence  
of the dogmatists whohad returned after study in  
Russia and could not relate their knowledge to reality,  
Mao was continuously eager to make the Party’s study  
and teaching linked to practice. He wanted to make  
Marxist philosophy and particularly the Marxist  
dialectical method of use to all Party cadre and  
activists and to the common masses.

The Theory of Knowledge: Of prime importance  
was Mao’s teaching on the theory of knowledge. An  
important work was his essay On Practice–On the  
RelationBetweenKnowledge and Practice, Between  
Knowing and Doing.Though it took only two hours  
of lectures, Mao said it had taken weeks to write. The  
central point, which Mao explains is that  
knowledge does not drop fromthe skies, it comes  
from social practice and from it alone. True  
knowledge, or correct ideas, come fromthree kinds  
of social practice – the struggle for production, the  
class struggle and scientific experiment.

Theory depends onpractice. It is unthinkable, said  
Mao, that it should not be measured and checked by  
practice. In turn, theory changes practice, changes our  
method of work and thinking. Through this is  
brought about the transformation and gaining of more  
knowledge. No one is bornwise, or born stupid.  
Knowledge cannot come before material experience;  
nobody can become an expert before practically doing  
a thing.

Mao explained the process of obtaining knowledge.  
It starts fromperceptual knowledge, the stage of  
sense perceptions and impressions, where manat  
first sees only the separate aspects, the external  
relations of things. As social practice continues,  
things that give rise to man’s sense perceptions and  
impressions in the course of his practice are  
repeated many times; then a sudden change (leap)  
takes place in the brain in the process of  
understanding, and concepts are formed. Concepts  
are no longer the phenomena, the separate aspects and  
the external relations of things; they grasp the essence,  
the totality and the internal relations of things.  
Between concepts and sense perceptions there is not  
only a quantitative but also a qualitative  
difference. Conceptual or logical or rational  
knowledge is a higher stage than the stage of  
perceptual knowledge.

There are two important aspects to this. One is  
that rational knowledge depends upon perceptual

knowledge. It is foolish to think that rational  
knowledge canbe developed without someone first  
experiencing and obtaining perceptual knowledge.  
The second important aspect is that perceptual  
knowledge remains to be developed into rational  
knowledge. This means that perceptual knowledge  
should be deepened and developed to the stage of  
rational knowledge.

The acquiring of rational knowledge is however  
not an end in itself. As Marxismhas always held,  
the essential point of all knowledge is to bring it  
into practice. Thus as Mao says,“Discover the truth  
through practice, andagain through practice verify  
and develop the truth. Start from perceptual  
knowledge and actively develop it into rational  
knowledge; thenstart from rational knowledge and  
actively guide revolutionary practice to change both  
the subjective and the objective world. Practice,  
knowledge, again practice, and againknowledge.  
This formrepeats itself in endless cycles, and with  
each cycle the content of practice and knowledge  
rises to a higher level. Such is the whole of the  
dialectical-materialist theory of knowledge, and  
such is the dialectical-materialist theory of the  
unity of knowing and doing.”

On Contradictions: The other important  
contribution of Mao to Marxist philosophy was in  
dialectics and particularly relating to the  
understanding and application of

contradictions. The understanding and use of  
contradictions appears at various points and almost  
throughout Mao’s analysis and writings. His main  
work is On Contradictions, which is an essay on  
philosophy written in August 1937 by Mao after his  
essay “On Practice” and with the same object of  
overcoming the serious error of dogmatist thinking to  
be found in the Party at the time. Originally this essay  
was presented as twolectures at the Anti-Japanese  
Military and Political College in Yenan.

Mao’s work was in a sense the continuation of work  
by Lenin who particularly made a deep study of  
contradictions. Lenin called contradiction‘the salt of  
dialectics’and stated that‘the division of the One and  
the knowledge of its contradictory parts is the essence  
of dialectics.’ Lenin further in his Philosophical  
Notebooks asserted, “In brief, dialectics can be  
defined as the doctrine of the unity of opposites.  
This embodies the essence of dialectics, but it  
requires explanations and development.”

These‘explanations and development’was done some  
twenty years later by Mao. Mao work was a leap in  
the understanding of contradictions. He examined  
the question of contradictions in great detail and  
clarified themin such a manner as to make themeasily  
understandable and easily useable by anybody.

Firstly he asserted that the law of the unity of  
opposites, is the fundamental lawof nature and of  
society and therefore also the fundamental lawof

thought.

Following fromthis he explained the principle of the  
universality and absoluteness of  
contradiction. According to this principle,  
contradiction is present in all processes of every object  
and of every thought and exists in all these processes  
frombeginning to end.

Next he gives the principle of the particularity and  
relativity of contradiction. According to this  
principle, each contradiction and each of its aspects  
have their respective characteristics.

A very important concept given by Mao in this  
respect is regarding the unity and struggle between the  
opposites in a contradiction. Mao points out the  
unity or identity of opposites is conditional; it is  
thus always temporary and relative. On the other  
hand the struggle of opposites is unending; it is  
universal and absolute.

Another important principle, whichMaogave and  
uses very often in his analysis, was the understanding  
of the principal contradiction and the principal  
aspect of a contradiction. According to this  
principle, there are many contradictions in the  
process of development of a complex thing, and  
one of them is necessarily the principal  
contradiction whose existence and development  
determines or influences the existence and  
development of the other contradictions. Hence, if

in any process there are a number of contradictions,  
one of them must be the principal contradiction  
playing the leading and decisive role, while the rest  
occupy a secondary and subordinate position.  
Therefore, in studying any complex process in which  
there are two or more contradictions, we must devote  
every effort to finding its principal contradiction.  
Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all  
problems can be readily solved.

Similarly, in any contradiction the development of the  
contradictory aspects is uneven. Sometimes they seem  
to be in equilibrium, which is however only  
temporary and relative, while unevenness is basic. Of  
the two contradictory aspects, one must be  
principal and the other secondary. The principal  
aspect is the one playing the leading role in the  
contradiction. The nature of a thing is determined  
mainly by the principal aspect of a  
contradiction, the aspect that has gained the  
dominant position.

Mao always gave central importance to understanding  
the principal contradiction in his analysis. Thus in his  
analysis of Chinese society he always analysed the  
principal contradiction. This was an advance over  
earlier Marxist-Leninist analysis, which did not  
particularly go into an analysis of the principal  
contradiction in a country or revolution. Mao  
however asserted that unless we examine two aspects–  
the principal and the non-principal contradictions in a

process, and the principal and the non-principal  
aspects of a contradiction–we shall get bogged down  
in abstractions, be unable to understand contradiction  
concretely andconsequently be unable to find the  
correct methodof resolving it. The importance of  
understanding the principal contradiction and the  
principal aspect of a contradiction was because they  
represented the unevenness of the forces that are in  
contradiction. Nothing in this world develops  
absolutely evenlyandtherefore it was necessaryto  
understand the change in the position of the principal  
and non-principal contradictions and the principal and  
non-principal aspects of a contradiction. It is only by  
understanding the various stages of unevenness in the  
contradictions and the process of change in these  
contradictions that a revolutionary party can decide  
on its strategy and tactics, both in political and  
military affairs.

Lastly Mao clarified regarding the question of  
antagonism in a contradiction. According to  
Mao antagonism is one form, but not the only  
form, of the struggle of opposites; the formula of  
antagonismtherefore cannot be arbitrarily applied  
everywhere. Some contradictions are characterised by  
open antagonism, others are not. In accordance with  
the concrete development of things, some  
contradictions, which were originally non-  
antagonistic, develop into antagonistic ones, while  
others which were originally antagonistic develop into  
non-antagonistic ones. Forms of struggle differ

according to the differences in the nature of the  
contradictions. Non-antagonistic contradictions  
can be solved by peaceful and friendly means.  
Antagonistic contradictions require non-peaceful  
means.

Mao came back to the question of antagonistic and  
non-antagonistic contradictions during the period of  
socialist construction and during the Cultural  
Revolution. He stressed that despite the victory of the  
revolution it was wrong to think that contradictions  
no longer existed in Chinese society. He showed that  
there were two different types of contradictions still  
existing–the contradictions with the enemy and the  
contradictions among the people. The contradictions  
with the enemy are antagonistic and had to be  
dealt with by suppression. On the other hand the  
contradictions among the people which are non-  
antagonistic had to be dealt with in such a way that  
they did not become antagonistic. Mao always  
stressed the need for the correct handling of  
contradictions. He pointed out that if  
contradictions were not understood and handled  
correctly there was always the danger of restoration  
of capitalism.

Chapter 28

Mao on The Party

Fromthe time that Mao took over the leadership of  
the CPChe made all efforts to develope the Party on  
true Leninist lines. Due to the domination of the  
earlier incorrect lines, particularly the third‘Left’Line  
of Wang Ming there were many deviations in party  
functioning. Due to the sectarian understanding there  
were no proper norms of democratic centralist  
functioning and a totally wrong approach to the two  
line struggle. Decisions were taken without  
consultationand without involving the Party cadre  
and by manipulating the holding of plenums and  
other meetings. Two line struggle was not conducted  
openly and representatives of another point of view  
were harassed and punished. Also due to dogmatism  
there was no implementation of mass line. Mao made  
all attempts to rectify these deviations as well as build  
up proper forums and bodies. In the process Mao also  
clarified and developed many organisational concepts.  
He also tried to correct certain wrong understanding  
that had grown in the international communist  
movement and also in the CPSUunder the leadership  
of Stalin.

Democratic Centralism: Mao’s attempt to correct  
sectarian andbureaucratic deviations is seenin his  
explanationregarding democratic centralism. Mao’s  
understanding of democratic centralismis clearly  
‘first democracy, then centralism’. He explained this

in many ways– ‘if there is no democracy there won’t  
be any centralism’,‘centralismis centralismbuilt on  
the foundation of democracy. Proletarian centralism  
with a broad democratic base’.

This view of Maowas based on his understanding  
that centralismmeant first of all the centralisation  
of correct ideas. For this to take it was necessary for  
all comrades to express their views and opinions and  
not keep it bottled up inside them. This would only  
be possible if there was the fullest possible democracy  
where comrades would feel free tostate what they  
want to say and even vent their anger. Therefore  
without democracy it would be impossible to sumup  
experience correctly. Without democracy, without  
ideas coming fromthe masses, it is impossible to  
formulate good lines, principles, policies or  
methods. However with proletarian democracy it  
was possible to achieve unity of understanding, of  
policy, plan, command and action on the basis of  
concentrating of correct ideas. This is unity  
through centralism.

Mao did not restrict the understanding of democratic  
centralismonly to party functioning. He broadened  
the understanding to the question of running the  
proletarian state and building the socialist economy.  
Mao felt that, without democratic centralism, the  
dictatorship of the proletariat could not be  
consolidated. Without broad democracy for the  
people, it was impossible for the dictatorship of the

proletariat to be consolidated or for political power to  
be stable. Without democracy, without arousing the  
masses and without supervision by the masses, it  
would be impossible to exercise effective dictatorship  
over the reactionaries and bad elements or to remould  
themeffectively. Mao was making these observations  
after the rise of modern revisionism inthe Soviet  
Union and saw that the masses had not been mobilised  
to exercise the dictatorship of the proletariat. He also  
sawthe rise of revisionist tendencies within the CPC  
at the highest levels and recognisedthat the only  
safeguardagainst suchtrends was the initiative and  
vigilance of the lower level cadre and the masses.

Thus Mao said in his talk in January 1962, “Unless we  
fully promote people’s democracy and inner-Party  
democracy and unless we fully implement  
proletarian democracy, it will be impossible for  
China to have true proletarian centralism. Without  
a high degree of democracy it is impossible to have  
a highdegree of centralism and without a high  
degree of centralismit is impossible to establish a  
socialist economy. And what will happen to our  
country if we fail to establish a socialist economy?  
It will turn into a revisionist state, indeed a  
bourgeois state, and the dictatorship of the  
proletariat will turn into a dictatorship of the  
bourgeoisie, and a reactionary, fascist dictatorship  
at that. This is a question, which very much deserves  
our vigilance, and I hope our comrades will give it a  
good deal of thought.”

The Two-Line Struggle is another aspect of party  
organisational principles, regarding which Mao  
developed Marxist understanding and theory. Mao’s  
approach, based on dialectical materialismwas to see  
incorrect opinions within the Communist Party as the  
reflection of alien classes in society. Thus as long as  
the class struggle continued insociety there was  
bound to be its reflection in the ideological  
struggle within the Party. His approach towards  
these contradictions too was different. He sawthem  
as non-antagonistic contradictions initially which  
through ‘serious struggle’ we should try to  
rectify. We should give ample opportunity to rectify  
and only if the people committing errors‘persist’or  
‘aggravate them’, then there was the possibility of the  
contradiction becoming antagonistic.

This was a correction of Stalin’s understanding, which  
he had presented in Foundations of Leninism. Stalin  
was opposed to any attempt to rectify wrong trends  
through inner-party struggle. He called such attempts  
as a“theory of ‘defeating’opportunist elements by  
ideological struggle within the Party”, which  
according to himwas“a rotten and dangerous theory,  
which threatens to condemn the Party to paralysis and  
chronic infirmity”. Such a presentation refused to  
accept the possibility of a non-antagonistic  
contradiction and treated the struggle against  
opportunism as an antagonistic contradiction from  
the very beginning.

Drawing lessons fromthe same historical experience,  
Mao presented the methods of inner-Party struggle in  
the following manner.“All leading members of the  
Party must promote inner-Party democracy and let  
people speak out. What are the limits? One is that  
Party discipline must be observed, the minority  
being subordinate to the majority and the entire  
membership to the Central Committee. Another  
limit is that no secret faction must be  
organised. We are not afraid of open opponents, we  
are only afraid of secret opponents. Such people do  
not speak the truth to your face, what they say is only  
lies and deceit. They don’t express their real intention.  
As long as a person doesn’t violate discipline and  
doesn’t engage in secret factional activities, we should  
allow himto speak out and shouldn’t punish himif he  
says wrong things. If people say wrong things, they  
can be criticised, but we should convince themwith  
reason. What if they are still not convinced? As long  
as they abide bythe resolutions and the decisions  
taken by the majority, the minority can reserve their  
opinions.”

Mao’s understanding thus was on the clear basis  
that as long as class struggle existed in society there  
was bound to be the class struggle in the  
Party—i.e., the two-line struggle. Therefore it was  
only correct that this struggle should be fought out  
openly according the principles of democratic  
centralism. Thus Mao, through his understanding and  
implementationof the concept of two-line struggle,

attempted to bring about a correct dialectical approach  
to classes, class struggle and inner-party struggle.

Mass-Line: Another area where Mao advanced  
Marxismwas regarding Mass-Line. Starting fromthe  
basic Marxist-Leninist understanding of the party  
maintaining the closest possible links with the masses,  
Mao developed the concept of mass-line to a  
qualitatively newlevel. At the philosophical level  
he showed howit was an essential aspect of the  
Marxist theory of knowledge. At the political and  
organisational levels, he showed howit was the  
basis of a correct political line and also howit was  
the essential organisational line of inner-party  
relations.

Mao explains that in the practical work of the  
Party, all correct leadership is necessarily ‘fromthe  
masses, to the masses’. This means: take the ideas of  
the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and  
concentrate them (through study turn them into  
concentrated andsystematic ideas), then go to the  
masses and propagate and explain these ideas until the  
masses embrace themas their own, hold fast to them  
and translate theminto action, and test the correctness  
of these ideas in such action. Then once again  
concentrate ideas fromthe masses and once again go  
to the masses so that the ideas are persevered in carried  
through. And so on, over and over again in an endless  
spiral, withthe ideas becoming more correct, more  
vital and richer each time. This, as Mao says, is the

Marxist theory of knowledge.

In order to bring into practice the principle‘fromthe  
masses, to the masses’, Mao explains that it is  
necessary to have a correct relationship between the  
leading group and the masses in an organisation or in a  
struggle. It is necessary that the party draws  
together the activists to form a nucleus of  
leadership and links this nucleus of leadership  
closely with the masses. If this is not done the  
leadership of the party becomes bureaucratic and  
divorced fromthe masses. It is also necessary that the  
leadership does not remain content with merely giving  
general calls. General calls must be followed up by  
particular and concrete guidance if they are to be  
properly implemented. “Take the ideas of the masses  
and concentrate them, then go to the masses, persevere  
in the ideas and carry themthrough, so as to form  
correct ideas of leadership—such is the basic method  
of leadership.”In this way Mao explains the mass-line  
as the basic method of leadership of the Party over the  
masses.

Lastly Mao says that the mass-line should not only be  
seen in the context of leadership of the Party over the  
masses. In fact Mao stresses on the application of the  
mass-line to inner-party relations also. He thus also  
saw it as anorganisational line. Mao points out  
that to ensure that the line really comes fromthe  
masses and particular that it really goes back to the  
masses, there must be close ties not only between

the Party and the masses outside the Party  
(between the class and the people), but above all  
between the Party’s leading bodies and the masses  
within the Party (between the cadres and the rank  
and the file). Thus Mao shows that it was of crucial  
importance that close ties be maintained between  
higher and lower levels of the Party. Any break up in  
inner-party ties would result in a gap in the relation  
between the party leadership and the masses. It would  
go against the implementation of the mass-line.

Chapter 29

Socialist Construction – The Chinese Experience

The implementation of the newdemocratic economic  
programme started even before nation-wide victory of  
the revolution. Soonafter the Red Army and the  
Chinese Revolution entered the strategic offensive in  
1947, Mao announced and started implementing what  
was called the three major economic policies of the  
new-democratic revolution. These were 1) the  
confiscation of the land of the feudal class and its  
distribution among the peasantry, 2) the  
confiscation of the capital of the comprador  
bourgeoisie and 3) protection to the industry and  
commerce of the national bourgeoisie. These  
policies were immediately taken up for  
implementation in the vast areas of Northern China  
which were under revolutionary control and the  
agrarian reform was completed there by mid-1950.  
Subsequently the agrarian reform programme was  
completed in the remainder of the country.

General Line and Step-by-Step Collectivisation: In  
1951, the party adopted what came to be known  
as the general line for socialist construction, for the  
period of transition fromcapitalism to socialism.  
The basic aimset for this period was to accomplish  
the industrialisation of China together with the  
socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts,  
and capitalist industry and commerce. The target  
set to complete this process was roughly eighteen

years. This was divided into three years of  
rehabilitation for recovering from the damage and  
destruction of the civil war plus fifteen years covering  
three five-year plans for planned development of the  
economy.

In accordance with this general line, a ‘step-by-step’  
plan was drawn up for the socialist transformation  
of agriculture. The first step was to call on the  
peasants to organise agricultural producers’  
mutual-aid teamsconsisting of only a fewto a dozen  
or so households each. These teams had only certain  
basic elements of socialismlike help and co-operation  
among the members of the team. The second step  
was to call on the peasants to organise small  
agricultural producers co-operatives on the basis of  
these mutual-aid teams. These co-operatives were  
semi-socialist in nature and were characterised by the  
pooling of land as shares and by unified  
management.Then the third step was to call on the  
peasants to combine further on the basis of these  
small semi-socialist co-operatives and organise large  
fully socialist agricultural producers’ co-  
operatives. The basic principles underlying this  
step-by-step plan were voluntary participation and  
mutual benefit. The peasants were to be persuaded  
to voluntarily participate in this process of  
collectivisation.

The first step of mutual-aid teams had started in the  
revolutionary bases even before the nation-wide

victory of the Revolution. The second step towards  
elementary co-operatives took place in the years 1953-

55.  The third step of transition to advanced co-  
    operatives came about in1956. There was a literal  
    upsurge of socialist transformation in the countryside.  
    Simultaneously, in the early months of 1956, a related  
    movement rapidly took ahead and completed the  
    process of nationalisation of businesses. Thus China’s  
    industry and commerce was transferred fromprivate  
    ownership to ownership by the whole people far  
    ahead of schedule.

Mao’s Dialectical Approach to the Process of  
Socialist Construction: The general line was basically  
reliant on the Soviet model of socialist construction.  
The emphasis on industry and particularly on heavy  
industry was the central directionof the First Five  
Year Plan of 1953-57. Further there was a tendency to  
uncritically adopt all Soviet policies. With the rise of  
modern revisionism in the Soviet Union (and  
particularly after the revisionist 20th Congress of the  
CPSUin February 1956), the revisionist tendencies in  
the CPCwere immediately strengthened. In 1956 a  
campaign was started from within the party to  
‘oppose rash advances’—i.e., to stall the process of  
socialisation. At same timethe revisionist theory of  
productive forces gained ascendancy within the  
party, with the prime representative being the  
party general secretary, Liu Shiao-chi. The  
representatives of this trend upheld the Kruschevites,  
negated the class struggle and concentrated attention

towards building modern productive forces, primarily  
throughheavy industry. Their argument was that  
the productive forces are the main motor of change  
and it was the backward productive forces in China  
that were the main factor holding back the  
development of the country. Changes in  
production relations should wait till after the  
productive forces had been developed enough. The  
cooperativisation of agriculture should wait until  
industries had developed enough to provide  
machinery for the rural mechanisation. All these  
proposals negated the importance of production  
relations and the class struggle. It would lead to  
growth of revisionist and bureaucratic trends and  
the growth of a new exploiting class.

Seeing the Soviet experience and realising the  
revisionist danger Mao immediately launched a  
struggle to defeat these trends which at that time  
controlled the party. His first step in this struggle  
was his speech of April 1956, On the Ten Major  
Relationships. In this speech, Mao for the first time  
made a clear-cut critique of the Soviet pattern of  
socialist economic construction. While referring to  
the relationship between heavy industry on the one  
hand and light industry and agriculture on the other,  
Mao stressed that “We have done better than the  
Soviet Union and a number of East European  
countries....Their lop-sided stress on heavy industry  
to the neglect of agriculture and light industry results  
in a shortage of goods on the market and an unstable

currency.”Similarly he criticised the Soviet policy of  
“squeezing the peasants too hard”. He also attacked  
the dogmatists within the CPCwho“copy everything  
indiscriminately andtransplant mechanically” while  
learning fromthe experience of the Soviet Union and  
other socialist countries. He also criticised those who  
were following the example of Kruschev in  
indiscriminately criticising Stalin. He upheld Stalin as  
a great Marxist with 70%achievements. Thus through  
this extensive critique of the Soviet revisionists and the  
mistakes in Soviet socialist construction, Mao led the  
struggle against the then dominant revisionist line of  
productive forces within the CPC.

However the biggest contribution of Mao’s speech was  
its major advancement of the understanding of the  
process of socialist construction and socialist planning.  
By presenting the problems of socialist construction as  
ten major relationships, Mao brought dialectics and  
contradictions to the centre of the process of  
building socialist society. He showed howsocialist  
construction involved not merely the mechanical  
implementation of targets of production and  
distribution, but a dialectical understanding of the  
main contradictions in the process, and the  
mobilising of all the positive forces to achieve  
socialism. Thus he said,“It is to focus on one basic  
policy that these ten problems are being raised, the  
basic policy of mobilising all positive factors, internal  
and external, to serve the cause of socialism...These  
ten relationships are all contradictions. The world

consists of contradictions. Without contradictions the  
world would cease to exist. Our task is to handle these  
contradictions correctly.”

Mao followed it up the next year with his work On  
the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the  
People. In it he continued the development of the  
dialectical understanding of the process of socialist  
construction. Primarily he also placed the class  
struggle at the very core of the process. He asserted  
that the “class struggle is by no means over...the  
question of which will win out, socialism or  
capitalism, is not really settled yet.” With this he  
began the struggle against the revisionist sections  
in the Party who were saying that class struggle no  
longer existed under socialism. This marked the  
beginning of a country-wide Rectification  
Movement, the Anti-Rightist Movement. During  
this period many high-level cadre had to present their  
self-criticismbefore the masses, millions of students  
involved themselves in manual labour to integrate  
with the workers and peasants, all party cadres in the  
factories and agricultural co-operatives had to  
participate in manual labour, workers began to  
participate in decision making intheir factories, a  
socialist education campaign started among the  
peasantry. Through this process the Party was brought  
closer to the people and rightist trends that were  
growing, both within the Party and outside were  
checked.

Great Leap Forward and the Birth of People’s  
Communes: With the progress of the rectification  
movement, the rightists in the party were thrown on  
the defensive. This led, in 1958, to a rectification of  
the erroneous productive forces theory which had  
dominated the Eighth Party Congress in1956. The  
prime mover of this theory, Liu Shiao-chi, was forced  
to admit before the Second Session of the Eighth  
Party Congress in May 1958, that, throughout the  
period before completion of the building of a  
socialist society, the principal contradiction was  
between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie,  
between the socialist road and the capitalist road.  
His report also mentioned the Great Leap Forward,  
which had then begun. There had been major  
advances on every front in socialist construction.  
Industry, agriculture and all other fields of activity  
had registered greater and more rapid growth.

Aside fromrapid growthhowever, the Great Leap  
Forward was a major change in the priorities of the  
earlier plans and general line. The general line of the  
Great Leap Forward had been formulated at a Central  
Committee meeting held at the end of November

1957.  It changed the emphasis on heavy industry  
    and aimed at the simultaneous development of  
    agriculture, heavy and light industry. It aimed at  
    reducing the gap between town and countryside,  
    between worker and peasant, and between worker  
    and peasant on the one hand and the intellectual  
    and manager on the other hand. It aimed at not

merely an economic revolution but a technological,  
political, social and cultural revolution to  
transformthe city and countryside.

In 1958 started the building of the people’s  
communes. The process first started spontaneously  
when neighbouring peasant associations in a drought  
affected area made a plan to merge together their  
labour and other resources to implement an irrigation  
project. Their merger was given the name commune  
by Mao. Maoencouraged such formation andthis  
immediately led to a rapid spread of communes  
throughout the country. They were formed bythe  
merger of neighbouring co-operatives in order to  
undertake large-scale projects suchas flood control,  
water conservancy, afforestation, fisheries, and  
transport. In addition, many communes set up their  
own factories for making tractors, chemical fertilisers,  
and other means of production. The movement to set  
up people’s communes grewvery rapidly. The CCof  
the CPCannounced in its famous Wuhan Resolution  
of December, 1958 that“Within a few months starting  
in the summer of 1958, all of the more than 740,000  
agricultural producers’co-operatives in the country, in  
response to the enthusiastic demand of the mass of  
peasants, reorganised themselves into over 26,000  
people’s communes. Over 120 million households, or  
more than 99 percent of all China’s peasant  
households of various nationalities, have joined the  
people’s communes.” Summing up the political  
essence, the CC went on to say: -

“The people’s commune is the basic unit of the  
socialist social structure of our country, combining  
industry, agriculture, trade, education, and  
military affairs; at the same time it is the basic  
organisation of the socialist state power. Marxist-  
Leninist theory and the initial experience of the  
people’s communes inour country enable us to  
foresee now that the people’s communes will  
quicken the tempo of our socialist construction and  
constitute the best form for realising, in our  
country, the following two transitions.

“Firstly, the transition fromcollective ownership to  
ownership by the whole people in the countryside;  
and,

“Secondly, the transition from socialist to  
communist society. It can also be foreseen that in  
the future communist society, the people’s  
commune will remain the basic unit of our social  
structure.”

Thus the commune movement represented a  
tremendous advance which basically completed the  
process of collectivisation of agriculture. However the  
expectation of the commune taking ahead the process  
of the transition to full public ownership and  
communismcould not be fulfilled to that extent. Also  
attempts at setting up urban communes could not be  
consolidated.

In the earliest period of the commune movement

during the Great Leap, there were certain‘left’errors.  
Mao in his speech in February 1959 called it a  
‘communist wind’. These ‘left’ errors, whichMao  
identified, were mainly of three types. The first was  
the levelling of the poor and the rich brigades  
within the commune by making the whole  
commune into one accounting unit. This meant that  
shares of the peasant members of richer brigades (the  
former advanced co-operative) would be smaller than  
the share they would receive soon after the commune  
was formed. They would thus resent the formation of  
the commune and their participationwould not be  
voluntary. The second error was that capital  
accumulation by the commune was too great and  
the commune’s demand for labour without  
compensation was too great. When larger amounts  
are kept aside for capital accumulation the share that  
the peasant gets is lower. Similarly more labour  
without compensation can only come where the  
consciousness has been raised to that extent. The  
third error was the ‘communisation’ of all kinds  
‘property’. In some areas attempts were made to even  
bring minor property of the peasant like hens and pigs  
under the commune. This too was opposed.

These errors were sooncorrected. The production  
brigade (former advanced co-operative), was kept as  
the basic accounting unit, and in 1962, this was  
brought to an even lower level, that of the production  
team. However, though the perspective remained  
always of raising the level of ownership and

accounting tohigher levels, as a process of greater  
socialisation and transition towards communism, this  
did not achieve success. The basic accounting and  
ownership unit continued till 1976, to remain at the  
lowest level—the production team.

Struggle against the Capitalist Roaders: Though the  
‘left’ errors were soon corrected, the hold of the  
capitalist roaders, led by Liu Shiao-chi, remained  
strong within the party’s higher levels. The two-line  
struggle was represented in direct and indirect ways. In  
July 1959, Peng The-huai, then Defence Minister,  
launched a direct attack on the Great Leap Forward,  
criticising what he called its “petty-bourgeois  
fanaticism”and desire“to enter into communismat  
one step”Mao repulsed these attacks and defended the  
politics of the Great Leap. However, though Peng was  
defeated, the other capitalist roaders continued their  
attacks through indirect means.

One method was through veiled defence of Peng and  
attacks on Mao in the media. This was through  
articles and also through plays and cultural  
performances intending to showhow Peng was an  
upright comrade who had been victimised. The other  
method was to stall or divert the implementation of  
key policies decided at the highest levels. Aprincipal  
example was sabotage of the programme of socialist  
education and the decision to launch a Cultural  
Revolution, taken by the Tenth Plenumof the CCin

1962.  Though this was formally agreed to by the

capitalist roaders, they ensured through their control  
within the party structure, to ensure that there was no  
mass mobilisation. Theytried toturnthe Cultural  
Revolution in the direction of academic and  
ideological debate rather than class struggle.

Mao, throughout this period (1959-65), fought the  
battle at various levels. He realised on the basis of the  
Russian experience, the very real danger of the  
restoration of capitalism. He, therefore, on the basis of  
a major study of the politics and economics of  
Kruschevite revisionism, drewthe theoretical lessons  
of this experience for the education of the Chinese and  
the international proletariat. Through the struggle  
of the Great Debate against Kruschev’s modern  
revisionism Mao tried to rally around the  
revolutionaries around the world and in  
China.Through his works like Critique of Soviet  
Economics and the CPC’s analysis of Kruschev’s  
Phoney Communismand its Historical Lessons for  
the World, he tried to inculcate in the party cadre the  
theoretical foundations for a fight against revisionism  
and restoration.

However he mainly tried to drawthe masses into  
the struggle to defend and develop socialismand  
prevent restoration of capitalism. Besides his earlier  
mentioned programme for socialist education, he also  
gave slogans for socialist emulation of the Tachai and  
Tach’ing experiences as model experiences in building  
socialism. But when all attempts to mobilise the

masses were diverted by the party bureaucracy,  
Mao succeeded after tremendous efforts in  
unleashing the energies of the masses through the  
Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It was the  
culmination in practice of Mao’s development of  
the Marxist principles of socialist construction.

Chapter 30

The Great Debate – Mao’s Fight Against  
Kruschev’s Modern Revisionism

In 1953, after the death of Stalin, a revisionist clique  
led by Kruschev, performed a coup, and took over the  
controls of the CPSU, then the leading party of the  
international proletariat. They threwout or killed the  
revolutionaries in the party, started the process of  
restoration of capitalismin the first land of socialism  
and proceededto develop ties with the imperialist  
camp, particularlyU.S. imperialism. By 1956, after  
securing firmcontrol over the CPSU, they, at the  
20th Congress of the CPSU, started spreading their  
revisionist poison among other communist parties.  
They simultaneously attacked the so-called Stalin  
personality cult and introduced their revisionist  
theory of the three peacefuls—peaceful transition,  
peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition.

Peaceful transition meant peaceful transition to  
socialism by the parliamentary road. Kruschev  
proposed that in the present era it was possible to  
achieve socialismby peacefully winning a majority in  
parliament and then bringing about reforms to bring  
in socialism. He thus denied the need for  
revolution. This theory was thus a repetition of the  
revisionism of Bernstein and other social-  
democrats.

Peaceful co existence between states having

different social systems was proposed by Kruschev  
as the general line of the foreign policy of the  
socialist state. He thus distorted Lenin’s policy of  
peaceful co existence with capitalist states, which was  
just one aspect of the socialist state’s foreign policy of  
proletarian internationalism. Kruschev subordinated  
all other things to his desire to maintain a peaceful  
existence withimperialism. He made relations with  
and aid to other socialist countries and the policy of  
help to the struggles of oppressed nations dependent  
upon the requirements of peaceful co existence with  
the imperialist powers. This was thus nothing but a  
policy of collaboration with imperialism.

Peaceful competition was the theory that the  
contradiction between imperialism and socialism  
would be resolved through economic competition  
betweenthe capitalist and socialist systems. This  
theory thus refused to recognise the reactionary  
and war mongering character of imperialism. It  
created the illusion that the contradiction between the  
socialist and imperialist camp was a non-antagonistic  
contradiction, which would be resolved through  
peaceful forms of struggle.

Kruschev’s theory of the three peacefuls was thus a  
full-fledged revisionist theory, which he wanted to  
impose on the international communist movement. It  
was directedtowards building up close relationship  
with imperialism. In order to implement his  
schemes and gain the acceptance of the imperialist

powers, Kruschev simultaneously launched a  
vicious attack on Stalin in the name of personality  
cult. In order to demolish the revolutionary  
principles that Stalin had stood and fought for it  
was first necessary to destroy the image of Stalin  
among the revolutionaries and the masses  
throughout the world. This was done througha  
campaign of lies and degenerate propaganda.

Many of the leaderships of the communist parties of  
the world backed the revisionist Kruschevite line.  
Many prominent leaders and parties had already  
started taking the revisionist line in their own  
countries. Browder in the USA had already put  
forward theories of collaboration betweensocialism  
andcapitalism andmoved out of the international  
communist movement; Thorez, the former Third  
International leader fromFrance, who developed close  
relations with the bourgeoisie following the period in  
the anti-fascist front, had in the post-war years taken  
national chauvinist positions towards the peoples of  
the French colonies and become a servant of the  
French imperialist bourgeoisie; Togliatti of Italy,  
another major Third International leader, had wanted  
to‘reform’and‘restructure’capitalisminto socialism  
through ‘structural reforms’ through the bourgeois  
parliament ; the Communist Party of India leadership  
had already changed their tactical line to recognise the  
peaceful path. Thus these revisionist forces, who had  
not been sufficiently criticisedand defeated in the  
earlier period, quite happily collaborated with

Kruschev.

Where however such parties tried in any serious  
manner to implement‘peaceful transition’through the  
electoral systemandwhere such efforts sufficiently  
threatened the social order, they were eliminated  
throughmilitary coups and savage repression, as in  
Brazil (1964), Indonesia (1965), and Chile (1973).

Among the newly formed People’s Democracies, the  
League of Communists of Yugoslavia, led by Tito, had  
already, from1948, started on the revisionist road and  
broken off fromthe socialist camp. Kruschev however  
soon started making friends with him. Most of the  
remaining leaderships also aligned with Kruschev.  
Within the socialist camp it was only the CPC and the  
Albanian Party of Labour who identified and  
recognised Kruschevite revisionismand made a valiant  
and determined defence of Marxism-Leninism.

The CPC, under Mao’s guidance was in the vanguard  
of this struggle. Within two months of the 20th CPSU  
Congress the CPC published an article On the  
Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the  
Proletariat, which upheld Stalin as an outstanding  
Marxist-Leninist. This was followed by another article  
in December 1956, More on the Historical Experience  
of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, which insisted  
that the socialist camp should clearly demarcate who  
are its friends and enemies. This was combined with a  
seven year long attempt to struggle with and defeat  
the Kruschevite revisionist line within party

forums, particularly at the meetings of 60 fraternal  
parties in 1957 and of 81 fraternal parties in 1960,  
and at meetings with the CPSU leadership.

As the struggle sharpened the Soviet Revisionists in  
June 1959 withdrewtechnical assistance in the field of  
defence, and in July 1960 withdrewsuddenly all the  
Soviet technical experts that were working in China.  
The same was done with Albania. In April 1960 the  
CPCpublished Long Live Leninism and two other  
articles upholding the basic principles of Leninismon  
imperialism, war and peace, proletarian revolution and  
the dictatorship of the proletariat. These articles  
opposed the revisionist positions of the CPSU  
without mentioning it by name.

The revisionists however continued with their  
attempts to further systemise their revisionist  
positions. Thus in the 22nd Congress of the CPSU  
held in 1961, the Programme adopted there revised the  
essence of Marxism-Leninism, namely, the teachings  
on proletarian revolution, on the dictatorship of the  
proletariat and on the party of the proletariat. It  
declared that the dictatorship of the proletariat was no  
longer needed in the Soviet Union and that the nature  
of the CPSUas the vanguard of the proletariat had  
changed. The Congress advanced absurd theories of a  
“state of the whole people”and a“party of the entire  
people”. At the Congress Kruschev launched an open  
and public attack on the Albanian Party and even gave  
a call to overthrowits leader, Enver Hoxha. This was

opposed by the CPC delegation led by Chou En-lai.

Kruschev also started encouraging other Communist  
Parties to launch public attacks on the CPC.  
Numerous articles in the Soviet also attacked the  
Chinese leadership. The CPCfinally started replying  
to some of the attacks of Togliatti of the Italian Party,  
Thorez of the French Party, Gus Hall of the CPUSA  
and others in series of seven articles which came out at  
the end of 1962 and the beginning of 1963.

A summary of the main views of the CPC were put  
down in the famous June 14th Letter of 1963,  
which was titled as A Proposal Concerning the  
General Line of the International Communist  
Movement. This was replied to by an Open Letter to  
the CPC by the CPSU. Since the whole issue was now  
in the open, the CPCdecided to conduct the debate  
through the open press. It brought out nine  
commentaries on the CPSU’s Open Letter and  
clarified all issues before the masses.

This struggle, which came out in the open in 1963  
and continued through 1964, came to be known as  
the Great Debate. The Great Debate was of immense  
historic significance. It was a principled and  
comprehensive struggle against modern revisionism. It  
provided the rallying point for all proletarian  
revolutionary forces throughout the world. It was also  
a scientific development of Marxism-Leninism, which  
gave the international communist movement its  
revolutionary general line for that period. Mao was

the driving force behind the struggle. It was through  
the Great Debate that Mao advanced the science of  
Marxism-Leninismby providing the answers to the  
most significant questions before the international  
proletariat—the fundamental contradictions in the  
world, who are friends and enemies, the aims of the  
movement, and the path for achieving the victory  
of World Socialist Revolution. These formulations  
were mainly contained in the June 14th Letter. The  
nine commentaries outlined and elaborated the  
revolutionary position on various crucial issues  
facing the international communist movement  
after the World War II—neo-colonialism, war and  
peace, peaceful existence, Yugoslavia, Kruschev’s  
revisionismand the historical lessons to be drawn  
therefrom. It was through the Great Debate that  
Maoismgained further acceptance as the guiding  
ideology of the revolutionary sections of the  
international proletariat.

Chapter 31

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

The Great ProletarianCultural Revolution(GPCR)  
was the answer of Marxism to the obstacles and  
sabotage of the process of socialist construction  
created by the Kruschevites and the capitalist roaders.  
Particularly after the rise of revisionismin the Soviet  
Union, Mao had realised that one of the biggest  
dangers of the restoration of capitalismcame from  
within the Party itself. Throughout the Great Debate,  
Mao, while fighting revisionism, tried to find the  
answer to the question of how to prevent the  
restoration of capitalism. He was at the same time  
deeply involved in the fight with the Chinese  
Kruschevites, like Liu Shiao- chi and Deng Tsiao-ping.  
Thus while concluding the Great Debate in the  
CPC’s last document, which was called On  
Kruschev’s Phoney Communismand its Historical  
lessons for the World, Mao stressed certain points  
on the question of prevention of the restoration of  
capitalism.

Mao firstly stressed the recognition of the need to  
continue the class struggle throughout the period  
of socialist society, right to the end. He explained  
that change in the ownership of the means of  
production, i.e. socialist revolution on the economic  
front is insufficient by itself. He insisted that we  
must have a thorough socialist revolution on the  
political and ideological fronts in order to

consolidate the revolution. And this revolution must  
be continued under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Another point that Mao repeatedly stressed was  
that in order to carry out this revolution it was  
necessary to stick to the mass line, and to boldly  
arouse the masses and to unfold mass movements  
on a large scale. For this the Party would have to rely  
on, win over and unite with the masses of the people,  
who constitute 95 per cent of the population, ina  
common struggle against the enemies of socialism.  
Mao also stressed the need “to conduct extensive  
socialist education movements repeatedly in the cities  
and the countryside.”In these continuous movements  
for educating the people Mao again stressed the need  
to organise the revolutionary class forces, and “to  
wage a sharp, tit-for-tat struggle against the anti-  
socialist, capitalist and feudal forces”. Thus Mao  
clearly sawthat the extensive participation of the  
masses was an essential precondition to prevent the  
restoration of capitalism. This came from Mao’s  
experience of howit was the revisionists fromwithin  
the leadership of the Party itself who were the main  
elements bringing about the restoration of capitalism.

However within the CPC itself there was strong  
resistance fromthe highest levels, led by Liu Shiao-chi,  
to the implementation of these theories and the  
concrete programme being proposed by Mao. Thus  
though the‘socialist cultural revolution’was officially  
accepted at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth

Central Committee in 1962, the implementation was  
half-heartedand ina direction counter to the line  
given by Mao. In fact the Party bureaucracy, under  
Liu’s control, started criticising Mao for the actions he  
was trying to take and opposing the action taken on  
capitalist roaders like Peng Te-huai. This criticismthey  
conducted through articles in the press and plays and  
other cultural forums which were in their full control.  
Their control was such that Mao could not even get an  
article defending himself printed in the press in  
Peking. Such an article defending Mao and his  
policies was finally published in November 1965 in  
the Shanghai press, which was a much more radical  
centre than Peking. This was what Mao later called  
‘the signal’ for the GPCRwhich started a flowof  
criticismof the party bureaucracy an support of  
Mao’s Line in the media and the field of culture.  
There also arose demands for self-criticismby the  
main culprits. The Party bureaucracy however did all  
they could to prevent this movement fromtaking on a  
mass character. The Cultural Revolution Group,  
which was supposed to initiate and direct it actually  
tried tocontrol the dissent and channelise it along  
academic lines.

Finally the CCunder the direction of Mao, issued a  
circular of 16th May, 1966, dissolved the‘Group of  
Five’, under whose charge the Cultural Revolution  
was being sabotaged, and set up a new ‘Cultural  
Revolution Group’ directly under the Politburo  
Standing Committee. This May 16th Circular gave

the call to criticise and break the resistance of the  
capitalist roaders, particularly those within the  
party. This action led to the actual initiation of the  
Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and made  
it a mass phenomenon involving millions of people.

On May 25th the first big character poster was put up  
at the Peking University criticising its vice-chancellor  
and the education system. This was only the first of  
thousands of such massive posters put up by the  
students and masses throughout the country where  
they expressed their opinion and criticised what they  
felt was wrong in society. Demonstrations and mass  
criticisms were held criticising professors, party  
bureaucrats and others for their wrong policies. Soon  
there was a demand froma section of students for the  
abolition of entrance examinations. The Central  
Committee in June passed an order suspending new  
admissions to colleges and universities for six months  
so that the students and youth could more fully  
participate in the GPCR. However the six month  
period proved too short and the universities only  
opened again after four years.

Mao too started personally participating in the  
GPCR. On July 17th he participated along with ten  
thousand other swimmers in a mile long swimwhich  
across the river Yangtze. This was his symbolic act  
signifying that he was participating in the flowing  
streamof the GPCR. Again on August 5th, during  
the EleventhPlenum meeting of the CPC, Mao

gave a much more straightforward signal. He put  
up his own big character poster. His main slogan  
was “Bombard the Headquarters!” This was a clear  
cut call to attack the capitalist headquarters of the  
capitalist roaders in the Party headed by Liu Shiao-  
chi. Mao’s call gave a further push to actions and  
militancy of the movement.

On August 18th Mao was present at the first rally of  
Red Guards in Peking–it was a million strong. The  
Red Guards were the members of the thousands of  
mass organisations that had sprung up throughout the  
country for participation in the GPCR. The first mass  
organisations were composed mainly of students and  
youth, but as the movement grewsuch organisations  
grew among the workers, peasants and office  
employees. The August 18th rally was the first of  
numerous such rallies. At some times there were over  
two millionRed Guards fromall over the country  
assembled in the capital.

The Eleventh Plenumdefined the GPCR as “a new  
stage in the development of the socialist revolution  
in our country, a deeper and more extensive stage.”  
Mao, in his closing speech at the Plenumsaid, “The  
great proletarian Cultural Revolution is in essence  
a great political revolution under socialist  
conditions by the proletariat against the  
bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes. It is the  
continuation of the long struggle against the  
Kuomintang reactionaries waged by the CPCand

the broad revolutionary masses under its  
leadership. It is continuation of the struggle  
between the proletariat and bourgeoisie.”

The Eleventh Plenum adopted what came to be  
known as the Sixteen Articles of the Cultural  
Revolution. They repeated what had been said by the  
May 16th Circular that the present revolution is to  
touch people’s souls, to change man. Old ideas,  
culture, customs, habits of the exploiting classes still  
mould public opinion, offering fertile ground for the  
restoration of the past. The mental outlook must be  
transformed and new values created.

It identified the main target as “those within the  
party who are in authority and are taking the  
capitalist road.” It identified the main forces of the  
revolution as “the masses of the workers, peasants,  
soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals and  
revolutionary cadres”.

The objective of the revolution was “to struggle  
against and crush those persons in authority who  
are taking the capitalist road, to criticise and  
repudiate the reactionary bourgeois academic  
‘authorities’ and the ideology of the bourgeoisie  
and all other exploiting classes and to transform  
education, art and literature and all other parts of  
the superstructure that do not correspond to the  
socialist economic base, so as to facilitate the  
consolidation and development of the socialist  
system.” The formof the revolution was to arouse

the masses in their hundreds of millions to air their  
views freely, write big-character posters, and hold  
great debates so that the capitalist roaders in power  
would be exposed and their plans to restore  
capitalismcould by smashed.

The essential aspect of the Cultural Revolution was  
the advancement and practical implementation of  
Mao’s mass line. It was aimed, not merely at  
eliminating the elements hostile to socialism, but to  
enable the working class to ‘exercise leadership in  
everything’, to ‘place politics in command of  
administration’, and to ensure that everyone serving as  
an official should‘remain one of the common people’.  
In order to achieve these aims it was necessaryto  
launch an all-out offensive against bourgeois ideology  
in such a way that the masses would be actively  
involved.

Thus, the Eleventh Plenumresolution instructed

“In the great proletarian Cultural Revolution, the  
only method is for the masses to liberate  
themselves, andany method of doing things on  
their behalf must not be used.

“Trust the masses, rely on themand respect their  
initiative. Cast out fear. Don’t be afraid of disorder.  
...Let the masses educate themselves in this great  
revolutionary and learn to distinguishright and  
wrong and between correct and incorrect ways of  
doing things.”

As the masses entered in full strength in the  
revolution they even created a neworganisational  
form—the revolutionary committee. It was based  
on the ‘three-in-one’ combination: that is, its  
members, who were elected, subject to recall, and  
directly responsible to the people, were drawn from  
the Party, the People’s Liberation Army, and the  
mass organisations (the Red Guards whose  
membership reached thirty million in number). They  
sprung up at all levels, fromthe factory or commune  
to the organs of provincial and regional government,  
and their functionwas to provide the linkthrough  
which the masses couldparticipate directly in the  
running of the country.

This three-in-one organ of power enabled  
proletarian political power to strikes deep roots  
among the masses. Direct participation by the  
revolutionary masses in the running of the country  
and the enforcement of revolutionary supervision  
frombelowover the organs of political power at  
various levels played a very important role in  
ensuring that leading groups at all levels adhered  
to the mass line. Thus this strengthening of the  
dictatorship of the proletariat, was also the most  
extensive and deepest exercise in proletarian  
democracy yet achieved in the world.

Under the initial sweep of the Cultural Revolution in  
1966-67, the bourgeois headquarters within the Party  
was effectively smashed, and most of the leading

capitalist roaders like Liu Shiao-chi and Deng Hsiao-  
ping and their supporters were stripped off their party  
posts and forced to do self-criticismbefore the masses.  
It was a great victory, whichnot only inspired the  
Chinese masses, but also created a wave of  
revolutionary enthusiasm among communist  
revolutionaries throughout the world.

During the Great Debate many revolutionary  
forces had gathered around the revolutionary line  
of the CPCled by Mao, but it was mainly during  
the Cultural Revolution that these forces  
throughout the world came to accept that it was  
Maoism that could provide the answers to the  
problems of World Socialist Revolution. The Great  
Proletarian Cultural Revolutionhad shown that  
Marxismhad an answer to the enemy of capitalist  
restoration. This advance in Marxism, led to the  
consolidation of numerous revolutionary groups  
and parties throughout the world on the basis of  
Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, and the launching of  
revolutionary struggles under their leadership.

However Mao warned,“The present Great Proletarian  
Cultural Revolution is only the first; there will  
inevitably be many more in the future. The issue of  
who will win in the revolution can only be settled  
over a long historical period. If things are not properly  
handled, it is possible for a capitalist restorationto  
take place at any time in the future.”

Further he reminded the Ninth PartyCongress in

1969,“We have won a great victory. But the defeated  
class will continue to struggle. Its members are still  
about and it still exists, therefore we cannot speak of  
the final victory, not for decades. We must not lose  
our vigilance. Fromthe Leninist point of view, the  
final victory in one socialist country not only requires  
the efforts of the proletariat and the broad masses at  
home, but also depends on the victory of the world  
revolution and the abolition of the system of  
exploitation of man by man on this earth so that all  
mankind will be emancipated. Consequently, it is  
wrong to talk about the final victory of the revolution  
in our country light-heartedly; it runs counter to  
Leninismand does not confirmto facts.”

Mao’s words proved true within a short time. First in  
1971 Lin Piao, then vice-chairman, who in the Ninth  
Congress of the CPC had been appointed as a  
successor to Mao, conspired to seize power through  
assassinating Mao and staging a military coup. This  
was foiled through the alertness of the revolutionaries  
in the party.

After this however, arch revisionists like Deng were  
rehabilitated back to high positions within the party  
and state apparatus. During the last period of the  
Cultural Revolution, there was again a struggle  
against these capitalist roaders and Deng was again  
criticised and removed fromall posts a few months  
before Mao’s death on 9th September 1976. He  
however had many of his agents in positions of power.

It was these renegades who engineered the coup to  
take over the party and lead it on the path of capitalist  
restoration very soon after the death of Mao. It was  
they who sabotaged the Cultural Revolution and then  
formally announced its end in 1976.

This coup and capitalist restoration however cannot  
repudiate the validity of the truthof the Cultural  
Revolution. Rather it, in a way, confirms Mao’s  
teachings on the nature of socialist societyand the  
need to continue the revolution under the dictatorship  
of the proletariat. The Cultural Revolution is a  
scientific tool developed in the struggle against  
capitalist restoration and in the theoretical struggle to  
develop Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. Its scientific  
validity has been established in the test of practice of  
the Chinese Revolution. Its effectiveness as a weapon  
to mobilise the vast masses in the struggle against the  
danger of capitalist restoration in a socialist country  
has also been proved. However, as Mao himself  
pointed out, no weapon can provide a guarantee of  
final victory. Thus, the fact that the capitalist roaders  
have achieved a temporary victory does not inany  
way diminish the objective truth of the necessity and  
effectiveness of this weapon in the fight for socialist  
construction and the defence of socialism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is one  
of the foremost contributions of Marxism-  
Leninism-Maoism to the arsenal of the  
international proletariat. It represents the

implementation in practice of Mao’s greatest  
contribution to Marxism—the theory of  
continuing revolution under the dictatorship of the  
proletariat to consolidate socialism, combat  
modern revisionismand prevent the restoration of  
capitalism. Its significance for the international  
proletariat is immeasurable in today’s world where all  
the socialist bases have been lost due to the  
manipulative schemes of the bourgeoisie within the  
communist party itself. Therefore the time has come  
to revise Lenin’s definition of a Marxist.

Lenin while defining a Marxist had said that it was not  
enough to accept the class struggle to be called a  
Marxist. He said it that only those who recognise both  
the class struggle and the dictatorship of the  
proletariat can be called Marxists. Today it not  
sufficient to only recognise the class struggle and the  
dictatorship of the proletariat to be a Marxist. A  
Marxist has to accept the basic understanding of the  
GPCR. Thus, only he is a Marxist who extends the  
recognition of the class struggle and the  
dictatorship of the proletariat to the recognition of  
the continuous revolution in the super structure  
with the aim of the completion of the world  
revolution and building communist society as early  
as possible.

Chapter 32

After The Death of Mao

The late 60s – the period of the GPCRand the  
establishment of Maoism as a new stage of  
Marxism-Leninism– was a period of revolutionary  
ferment in many parts of the world. The  
revolutionarywar in Indo-China (the area covering  
Vietnam, Kampuchea and Laos) was dealing severe  
blows to the tremendous military might of the US  
imperialists. Simultaneously revolutionaries breaking  
away from the hold of the modern revisionists  
launched armed struggles under the guidance of  
Maoismin many parts of the Third World during this  
period –the ongoing armed struggles in the  
Philippines and India are a continuation since then.  
National liberation struggles waging guerrilla war  
were also raging invarious parts, as well as armed  
struggles under Guevarist ideology (ideology  
following the views and practice of Che Guevara, who  
played a leading role in the revolutionary struggles in  
Cuba and Bolivia) in parts of Latin America.

The Indo-China war, the sharpening struggles in the  
Third World, and the GPCRwere among the major  
factors for the vast out break of students and anti-war  
movements throughout the capitalist world at the end  
of the sixties. The Paris student revolt of May 1968  
was the most significant but only one of a wave of  
student revolt ranging fromthe USAto Italy and even  
to Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. It also had

its impact on student movements in various parts of  
the Third World. At the same time the anti-Vietnam  
war protests started picking up in the USAand other  
parts of the world with massive peace movements  
against war and the nuclear arms race in major cities  
of Europe. The US imperialists were effectively  
isolated as not even one of their allies agreed to send  
troops to fight in Vietnam. Following the students  
movement there was also a major growth of struggles  
of the industrial working class in the West European  
countries particularly Italy and France, though largely  
on economic demands. Huge waves of strikes with  
major wage demands often paralysed entire economies  
of the imperialist countries.

The mid-70s sawthe final overthrowof many long  
standing colonial regimes after long guerrilla wars.  
Thus the US and their puppets were thrown out of  
Vietnam, Kampuchea and Laos in1975. In Africa the  
republics of Mozambique, Angola, Ethiopia, Congo,  
and Benin were formed in this period. However most  
of these countries were taken over by puppets or  
satellites of the new imperialism – Soviet social  
imperialism. Aprominent exception was Kampuchea,  
where genuine communist revolutionaries – the  
Khmer Rouge–remained independent until invaded  
in 1978 by Vietnam on the behest of the Soviet  
imperialists.

In the following period too there has continued to  
be an excellent revolutionary situationwith the

sharpening of all the fundamental contradictions  
and the further weakening of imperialism. In  
particular the colonies and semi-colonies have  
continued to be the storm centres of world  
revolution. At the beginning of this period guerrilla  
struggles continued in Zimbabwe, Nicaragua, Eritrea  
and other countries. The People’s War started in Peru  
in1980 under communist revolutionary leadership.  
The Shah of Iran was overthrown and an anti-  
American Islamic Republic came into existence.  
National liberation war broke out in Afghanistan after  
the installation of a Soviet puppet regime in 1978 and  
occupationbythe Soviet social imperialist army in

1979.  The heroic struggle of the Afghan people dealt a  
    serious deathblowto the Soviet regime and proved to  
    be a major factor in the final collapse of the USSR.

The epochal significance of the struggles of the  
peoples of the colonies and semi-colonies has been  
that it has forever changed the nature of the  
relations between imperialism and the oppressed  
nations. Both the Vietnamand Afghan wars proved  
that even a superpower could not occupy even a small  
and weak country. This truth was brought out even  
more starkly in the 90s in the numerous spots where  
UN peacekeeping forces tried to intervene.  
Somaliland, which had been controlled for numerous  
years without major difficulty by British and Italian  
colonialists, had in the 90s become the Somalia where  
thousands of American and other troops were forced  
to retreat in disgrace, when attacked by the people.

Even the large scale and continuous bombing of Iraq  
and Yugoslavia without the commitment of ground  
troops is the recognition by imperialism that no  
country, nation or people wouldinthis period be  
prepared to accept an occupation army.

Ever since the collapse of the bureaucratic regimes in  
East Europe and the various republics of the former  
Soviet Union, there has been a continuous  
revolutionarycrisis there too. Eveninthe Western  
imperialist countries the worsening of the crisis has  
led to the intensification of the contradiction between  
labour and capital and repeated waves of strike  
struggles by the industrial working class. The  
revolutionary forces however have not been  
organisationally strong enough to utilise the  
excellent world-wide revolutionary situation to  
advance the World Socialist Revolution

After the death of Mao in1976, the capitalist  
roaders who had remained in the party staged a  
coup under the leadership of the arch revisionist  
Deng Tsiao-ping and took over the control of the  
party under the nominal leadership of Hua Kuo-feng,  
a so-called centrist. As Mao had oftentaught, with  
political control going over to the hands of the  
revisionists the socialist base had gone out of the  
hands of the proletariat. At the same time the  
leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour  
switched over to an opportunist line attacking  
Maoismand projecting Mao as a petty bourgeois

revolutionary. Though the Khmer Rouge continued  
to hold power inKampuchea they were waging a  
constant struggle against the internal and external  
enemies of the Revolution and were yet toemerge  
fromthe economic ravages of war and consolidate  
their rule when they were defeated by the Soviet  
backed Vietnamese Army. Thus there was no  
country anywhere in the world where the  
proletariat had consolidated its hold on state power  
and could play the role of a socialist base for the  
international proletariat.

In the years immediately after the death of Mao,  
there was a considerable amount of ideological  
confusion in the international communist  
movement, with the Deng revisionists, through  
Hua Kuo-feng, attempting to project themselves as  
upholders of Maoism. In particular they falsely  
peddled the revisionist Three World Theory as  
Mao’s general line for the international proletariat.  
Many revolutionary sections accepted these positions  
and it was only after the very openly revisionist  
History Resolution of the CPC in 1981 and the  
Twelfth Congress in 1982 that most revolutionary  
forces throughout the world started coming out  
openly against Deng revisionism. However some  
sections continued to followthe Dengist revisionist  
line and abandoned Mao’s revolutionary teachings.  
Certain other sections allied themselves with the  
opportunist attack by the Albanian Party of Labour  
on Maoism. However these parties later either

disintegrated or openly revealed their revisionist  
nature.

Those that resolutely opposed Deng revisionism  
and upheld Maoism in practice could however  
make considerable advances. Today these forces  
formthe core of the revolutionary international  
proletariat. They are leading armedstruggles in  
Peru, Philippines, Turkey, Nepal and India.  
Though these forces are organisationally yet very  
weak, they continue to grow in strength.

The principal source of their growth in strength is  
the correctness of the ideology of Marxism-  
Leninism-Maoism. The chain of main historical  
events in the last twenty odd years has confirmed  
most of the assessments of Maoism. In particular  
the collapse of the Soviet Union and its retreat  
from super power status in the face of people’s  
struggles and the serious weakening of the  
American super power in the face of the struggles  
of oppressed peoples of the world, have confirmed  
the assessment by Mao that these imperialists were  
only paper tigers who would be taught a lesson by  
the people.

Similarly Maoismhas remained the best tool in the  
hands of the international proletariat and  
oppressed peoples to formulate and implement the  
programme for revolution in their own respective  
countries. It has also had a major influence over  
the armed struggles for national liberation being

waged in various corners of the globe.Though in  
this period there has not been any major or significant  
developments inMarxist science andtheory, MLM  
continues to be adaptable to the changing conditions  
in the world. It yet provides the only scientific and  
correct theory for the international proletariat.

The international communist movement is going  
through the process of victory-defeat-victory on the  
road to ultimate victory in the World Socialist  
Revolution. For those who would get despondent due  
to the ups and downs of this process it would help to  
remember the understanding given by Mao during the  
Great Debate and also during the Cultural  
Revolution, “Even the bourgeois revolution, which  
replaced one exploiting class by another, had to  
undergo repeated reversals and witness many  
struggles—revolution, then restoration and then  
the overthrow of restoration. It took many  
European countries hundreds of years to complete  
their bourgeois revolutions fromthe start of the  
ideological preparations to the final conquest of  
state power. Since the proletarian revolution is a  
revolution aimed at completely ending all systems  
of exploitation, it is still less permissible to imagine  
that the exploiting classes will meekly allow the  
proletariat to deprive themof all their privileges  
without seeking to restore their rule.”

Temporary defeats are therefore but to be expected  
on the long and tortuous path of the World  
Socialist Revolution. The history of 150 years of

the development of Marxism-Leninism-Maoismhas  
however conclusively proved that it is the historical  
destiny of this doctrine alone to lead and guide the  
international proletariat to final victory.
