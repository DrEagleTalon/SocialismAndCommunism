#### Marx and Marxism

###### Presented by Andy Blunden 6th-10th July 2pm-4pm

#### Introductory Level

This course will focus on a series of 8 key texts written by Karl Marx himself, rather than  
attempting to present yet another overview or ‘user manual’ of Marxism. In this way, participants  
will be able to gain a thorough grasp of Marx’s legacy based on familiarity with Marx’s own  
writings. Participants will appreciate why Marx became the icon of a revolutionary workers’  
movement, and why a serious study of his work is the _sine qua non_ of understanding twentieth  
century social theory and philosophy. The final day of the course will be devoted to assessing the  
reception of Marx in the social movement known as ‘Marxism’.

The prescribed texts are:

1.  The Communist Manifesto (1848)
2.  Third Address to the International on the Paris Commune (1871)
3.  Theses on Feuerbach (1845)
4.  The “Method of Political Economy” from The _Grundrisse_ (1857) and an excerpt  
    from the Preface to _“_ A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.” (1859)
5.  Introduction to Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right (1843)
6.  The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (Chapter 1. 1852)
7.  Capital, Volume I, Chapter 1, Commodities (excluding §3 1867)
8.  Capital, Volume III, Chapter 2, The Rate of Profit (posthumous).

The presenter will introduce the texts and situate them in their historical context. Two texts will be  
discussed each day in order, except for Friday, which has no prescribed reading. It is absolutely  
essential that all participants read the relevant texts beforehand, as the seminar will rely on dialogue  
on the content and meaning of the prescribed text. The reading is not at all heavy by the standards  
of MSCP courses, but is very rich. These texts have been subject to multiple interpretations over  
the past 150 years and it is important that participants ground their understanding in a reading of  
the original work. About half of the reader is prescribed for the first day.

Each 2-hour seminar will be divided into two 1-hour sessions, each focusing on a different text.  
The texts are available on line at marx.org where there are also study guides to assist reading.

```

Reading will not be required for the final day, which will deal with Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, Mao and  
Stalin, as leaders of mass movements originating from the First International, founded by Marx and  
others in 1864.

If possible, it would be an advantage to read Francis Wheen’s biography: “Karl Marx.”

## The Communist Manifesto

## (February 1848)

A spectre is haunting Europe – the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have  
entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot,  
French Radicals and German police-spies.

Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in  
power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism,  
against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?

Two things result from this fact:

I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.

II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their  
views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism  
with a manifesto of the party itself.

To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the  
following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and  
Danish languages.

#### I. Bourgeois and Proletarians

The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.

Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a  
word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an  
uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a  
revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.

In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of  
society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have  
patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters,  
journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.

The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done  
away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression,  
new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has  
simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great  
hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other – Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From  
these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.

The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising  
bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the  
colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to  
commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the  
revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.

The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was monopolised by closed  
guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing  
system took its place. The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing  
bourgeois; division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of  
division of labour in each single workshop.

Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacturer no longer  
sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production. The place of  
manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry; the place of the industrial bourgeois by  
industrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.

2 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

Modern industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of America paved  
the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to  
communication by land. This development has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of industry;  
and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion  
the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every class  
handed down from the Middle Ages.

We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of  
development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.

Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political  
advance of that class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and  
self-governing association in the medieval commune: here independent urban republic (as in  
Italy and Germany); there taxable “third estate” of the monarchy (as in France); afterwards, in  
the period of manufacturing proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a  
counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general,  
the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market,  
conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The executive  
of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole  
bourgeoisie.

The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.

The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal,  
idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his  
“natural superiors,” and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked  
self-interest, than callous “cash payment.” It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of  
religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of  
egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the  
numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom –  
Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has  
substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to  
with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of  
science, into its paid wage labourers.

The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family  
relation to a mere money relation.

The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the  
Middle Ages, which reactionaries so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most  
slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about. It has  
accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic  
cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and  
crusades.

The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production,  
and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society.  
Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first  
condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production,  
uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation  
distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their  
train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones  
become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is  
profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and  
his relations with his kind.

The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the  
entire surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections  
everywhere.

The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character  
to production and consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has

The Communist Manifesto 3

drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood. All old-established  
national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new  
industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, by  
industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the  
remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter  
of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new  
wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old  
local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction,  
universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The  
intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness  
and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national  
and local literatures, there arises a world literature.

The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely  
facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into  
civilisation. The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down  
all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians’ intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to  
capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of  
production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to  
become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image.

The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has created enormous  
cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus  
rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the  
country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries  
dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the  
West.

The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of  
the means of production, and of property. It has agglomerated population, centralised the means  
of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this  
was political centralisation. Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate  
interests, laws, governments, and systems of taxation, became lumped together into one nation,  
with one government, one code of laws, one national class-interest, one frontier, and one  
customs-tariff.

The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and  
more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of  
Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-  
navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation,  
canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground – what earlier century had  
even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?

We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie  
built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these  
means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and  
exchanged, the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the  
feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive  
forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.

Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution  
adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class.

A similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern bourgeois society, with its  
relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such  
gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to  
control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For many a decade  
past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive  
forces against modern conditions of production, against the property relations that are the  
conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule. It is enough to mention the  
commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society  
on its trial, each time more threateningly. In these crises, a great part not only of the existing

4 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

products, but also of the previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed. In  
these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an  
absurdity – the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state  
of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off  
the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and  
why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry,  
too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further  
the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too  
powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these  
fetters, they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of  
bourgeois property. The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth  
created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by  
enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new  
markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the  
way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby  
crises are prevented.

The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against  
the bourgeoisie itself.

But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called  
into existence the men who are to wield those weapons – the modern working class – the  
proletarians.

In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the  
proletariat, the modern working class, developed – a class of labourers, who live only so long as  
they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital. These  
labourers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of  
commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the  
fluctuations of the market.

Owing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labour, the work of the  
proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He  
becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and  
most easily acquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman  
is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance, and  
for the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is  
equal to its cost of production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work  
increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of  
labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by  
prolongation of the working hours, by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by  
increased speed of machinery, etc.

Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great  
factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised  
like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect  
hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the  
bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and,  
above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism  
proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering  
it is.

The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, in other words, the more  
modern industry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of  
women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the  
working class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their  
age and sex.

No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so far, at an end, that he  
receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the  
landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.

The Communist Manifesto 5

The lower strata of the bourgeoisie – the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, and retired tradesmen  
generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants – all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly  
because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is  
carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their  
specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production. Thus the proletariat is  
recruited from all classes of the population.

The proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its birth begins its struggle  
with the bourgeoisie. At first the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by the  
workpeople of a factory, then by the operative of one trade, in one locality, against the  
individual bourgeois who directly exploits them. They direct their attacks not against the  
bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments of production themselves; they  
destroy imported wares that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they set  
factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle  
Ages.

At this stage, the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country, and  
broken up by their mutual competition. If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies,  
this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of the union of the bourgeoisie,  
which class, in order to attain its own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in  
motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so. At this stage, therefore, the proletarians  
do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute monarchy,  
the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty bourgeois. Thus, the whole historical  
movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained is a victory  
for the bourgeoisie.

But with the development of industry, the proletariat not only increases in number; it becomes  
concentrated in greater masses, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various  
interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised,  
in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces  
wages to the same low level. The growing competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting  
commercial crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating. The increasing  
improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and  
more precarious; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more  
and more the character of collisions between two classes. Thereupon, the workers begin to form  
combinations (Trades’ Unions) against the bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the  
rate of wages; they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for  
these occasional revolts. Here and there, the contest breaks out into riots.

Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies,  
not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. This union is helped  
on by the improved means of communication that are created by modern industry, and that place  
the workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just this contact that was  
needed to centralise the numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into one national  
struggle between classes. But every class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to  
attain which the burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries,  
the modern proletarian, thanks to railways, achieve in a few years.

This organisation of the proletarians into a class, and, consequently into a political party, is  
continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves. But it ever  
rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It compels legislative recognition of particular  
interests of the workers, by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself. Thus,  
the ten-hours’ bill in England was carried.

Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further, in many ways, the course of  
development of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle. At first  
with the aristocracy; later on, with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have  
become antagonistic to the progress of industry; at all time with the bourgeoisie of foreign  
countries. In all these battles, it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for help,  
and thus, to drag it into the political arena. The bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the

6 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

proletariat with its own elements of political and general education, in other words, it furnishes  
the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie.

Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling class are, by the advance of  
industry, precipitated into the proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of  
existence. These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress.

Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the progress of dissolution  
going on within the ruling class, in fact within the whole range of old society, assumes such a  
violent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the  
revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an earlier  
period, a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the  
bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists,  
who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement  
as a whole.

Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a  
really revolutionary class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern  
Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product.

The lower bourgeoisie, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these  
fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the  
bourgeoisie. They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more, they are  
reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance, they are revolutionary,  
they are only so in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat; they thus defend not  
their present, but their future interests, they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at  
that of the proletariat.

###### The “dangerous class,” [lumpenproletariat] the social scum, that passively rotting mass

thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society, may, here and there, be swept into the  
movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more for the  
part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.

In the condition of the proletariat, those of old society at large are already virtually swamped.  
The proletarian is without property; his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything  
in common with the bourgeois family relations; modern industry labour, modern subjection to  
capital, the same in England as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him of every  
trace of national character. Law, morality, religion, are to him so many bourgeois prejudices,  
behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests.

All the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their already acquired status  
by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation. The proletarians cannot  
become masters of the productive forces of society, except by abolishing their own previous  
mode of appropriation, and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation. They have  
nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission is to destroy all previous securities  
for, and insurances of, individual property.

All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of  
minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the  
immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of  
our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata  
of official society being sprung into the air.

Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at  
first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters  
with its own bourgeoisie.

In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or  
less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out  
into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for  
the sway of the proletariat.

Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism of  
oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be  
assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its slavish existence. The serf, in the period of

The Communist Manifesto 7

serfdom, raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty bourgeois, under the  
yoke of the feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a bourgeois. The modern labourer, on  
the contrary, instead of rising with the process of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the  
conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more  
rapidly than population and wealth. And here it becomes evident, that the bourgeoisie is unfit  
any longer to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon  
society as an over-riding law. It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence  
to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has  
to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in  
other words, its existence is no longer compatible with society.

The essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois class is the  
formation and augmentation of capital; the condition for capital is wage-labour. Wage-labour  
rests exclusively on competition between the labourers. The advance of industry, whose  
involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to  
competition, by the revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modern  
Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie  
produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its  
own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.

#### II. Proletarians and Communists

In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole? The Communists do  
not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties. They have no interests  
separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole. They do not set up any sectarian  
principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.

The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 1. In the  
national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the  
front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. 2. In the  
various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie  
has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a  
whole.

The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute  
section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all  
others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the  
advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general  
results of the proletarian movement.

The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties:  
formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of  
political power by the proletariat.

The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that  
have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.

They merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an existing class struggle,  
from a historical movement going on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing property  
relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism.

All property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent  
upon the change in historical conditions.

The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property.

The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the  
abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most  
complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on  
class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.

In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition  
of private property.

We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally  
acquiring property as the fruit of a man’s own labour, which property is alleged to be the  
groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.

Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of  
the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to  
abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still  
destroying it daily.

Or do you mean the modern bourgeois private property?

But does wage-labour create any property for the labourer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that  
kind of property which exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon condition  
of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is  
based on the antagonism of capital and wage labour. Let us examine both sides of this  
antagonism.

To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status in production. Capital  
is a collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort,  
only by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.

Capital is therefore not only personal; it is a social power.

When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of  
society, personal property is not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social  
character of the property that is changed. It loses its class character.

Let us now take wage-labour.

The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of the means of  
subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the labourer in bare existence as a labourer.  
What, therefore, the wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely suffices to  
prolong and reproduce a bare existence. We by no means intend to abolish this personal  
appropriation of the products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and  
reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of  
others. All that we want to do away with is the miserable character of this appropriation, under  
which the labourer lives merely to increase capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the  
interest of the ruling class requires it.

In bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour. In Communist  
society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the  
labourer.

In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in Communist society, the  
present dominates the past. In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality,  
while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.

And the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and  
freedom! And rightly so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and  
bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.

By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free  
selling and buying.

But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also. This talk about  
free selling and buying, and all the other “brave words” of our bourgeois about freedom in  
general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the  
fettered traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic  
abolition of buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production, and of the  
bourgeoisie itself.

You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society,  
private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the  
few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us,  
therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose  
existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.

The Communist Manifesto 9

In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is  
just what we intend.

From the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital, money, or rent, into a  
social power capable of being monopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can  
no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital, from that moment, you say,  
individuality vanishes.

You must, therefore, confess that by “individual” you mean no other person than the bourgeois,  
than the middle-class owner of property. This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and  
made impossible.

Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does  
is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such  
appropriations.

It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all work will cease, and  
universal laziness will overtake us.

According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer  
idleness; for those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything  
do not work. The whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology: that there  
can no longer be any wage-labour when there is no longer any capital.

All objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating material  
products, have, in the same way, been urged against the Communistic mode of producing and  
appropriating intellectual products. Just as, to the bourgeois, the disappearance of class property  
is the disappearance of production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical  
with the disappearance of all culture.

That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a mere training to act  
as a machine.

But don’t wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition of bourgeois property,  
the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom, culture, law, &c. Your very ideas are but the  
outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your  
jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all, a will whose essential  
character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class.

The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of  
reason, the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property –  
historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production – this misconception  
you share with every ruling class that has preceded you. What you see clearly in the case of  
ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal property, you are of course forbidden to  
admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of property.

Abolition [Aufhebung] of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of  
the Communists. On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On  
capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form, this family exists only among the  
bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family  
among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.

The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both  
will vanish with the vanishing of capital. Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation  
of children by their parents? To this crime we plead guilty. But, you say, we destroy the most  
hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social.

And your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social conditions under which  
you educate, by the intervention direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, &c.? The  
Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter  
the character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class.

The bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about the hallowed co-relation of  
parents and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry,  
all the family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their children transformed into  
simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour.

But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the bourgeoisie in chorus.

The bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of  
production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion that  
the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women.

He has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with the status of women  
as mere instruments of production.

For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the  
community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the  
Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce community of women; it has existed  
almost from time immemorial.

Our bourgeois, not content with having wives and daughters of their proletarians at their  
disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other’s  
wives.

Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the  
Communists might possibly be reproached with is that they desire to introduce, in substitution  
for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised community of women. For the rest, it is self-  
evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of  
the community of women springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and  
private.

The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality.

The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got. Since the  
proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the  
nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois  
sense of the word.

National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing,  
owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to  
uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.

The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the  
leading civilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the  
proletariat.

In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be put an end to, the  
exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism  
between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an  
end.

The charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical and, generally, from an  
ideological standpoint, are not deserving of serious examination.

Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man’s ideas, views, and conception, in one  
word, man’s consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material  
existence, in his social relations and in his social life?

What else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production changes its character  
in proportion as material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the  
ideas of its ruling class.

When people speak of the ideas that revolutionise society, they do but express that fact that  
within the old society the elements of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of  
the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.

When the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient religions were overcome by  
Christianity. When Christian ideas succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal  
society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious  
liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition  
within the domain of knowledge.

“Undoubtedly,” it will be said, “religious, moral, philosophical, and juridical ideas have been  
modified in the course of historical development. But religion, morality, philosophy, political  
science, and law, constantly survived this change.”

The Communist Manifesto 11

“There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all states  
of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality,  
instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical  
experience.”

What does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all past society has consisted in the  
development of class antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at different  
epochs.

But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages, viz., the  
exploitation of one part of society by the other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness  
of past ages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays, moves within certain common  
forms, or general ideas, which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of  
class antagonisms.

The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no  
wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.

But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.

We have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the  
proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy.

The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the  
bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the  
proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as  
possible.

Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the  
rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures,  
therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the  
movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are  
unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.

These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.

Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.

1.  Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.
2.  A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
3.  Abolition of all rights of inheritance.
4.  Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
5.  Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State  
    capital and an exclusive monopoly.
6.  Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.
7.  Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into  
    cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a  
    common plan.
8.  Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
9.  Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the  
    distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over  
    the country.
10.  Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its  
    present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &c, &c.

When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has  
been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will  
lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of  
one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is  
compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a  
revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions  
of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the

12 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own  
supremacy as a class.

In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an  
association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of  
all.

#### III. Socialist and Communist Literature

##### 1. Reactionary Socialism

###### A. Feudal Socialism

Owing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the aristocracies of France and  
England to write pamphlets against modern bourgeois society. In the French Revolution of July  
1830, and in the English reform agitation, these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful  
upstart. Thenceforth, a serious political struggle was altogether out of the question. A literary  
battle alone remained possible. But even in the domain of literature the old cries of the  
restoration period had become impossible.

In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy was obliged to lose sight, apparently, of its own  
interests, and to formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the  
exploited working class alone. Thus, the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on  
their new masters and whispering in his ears sinister prophesies of coming catastrophe.

In this way arose feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half lampoon; half an echo of the past, half  
menace of the future; at times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the bourgeoisie  
to the very heart’s core; but always ludicrous in its effect, through total incapacity to  
comprehend the march of modern history.

The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for  
a banner. But the people, so often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal  
coats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.

One section of the French Legitimists and “Young England” exhibited this spectacle.

In pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of the bourgeoisie, the  
feudalists forget that they exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite different  
and that are now antiquated. In showing that, under their rule, the modern proletariat never  
existed, they forget that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own form of  
society.

For the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary character of their criticism that their chief  
accusation against the bourgeois amounts to this, that under the bourgeois régime a class is  
being developed which is destined to cut up root and branch the old order of society.

What they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a proletariat as that it  
creates a revolutionary proletariat.

In political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive measures against the working class; and  
in ordinary life, despite their high-falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the golden apples  
dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter truth, love, and honour, for traffic in wool,  
beetroot-sugar, and potato spirits.

As the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord, so has Clerical Socialism with  
Feudal Socialism. Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge. Has not  
Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, against the State? Has it not  
preached in the place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh,  
monastic life and Mother Church? Christian Socialism is but the holy water with which the  
priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.

###### B. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism

The feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by the bourgeoisie, not the only  
class whose conditions of existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois  
society. The medieval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the

The Communist Manifesto 13

modern bourgeoisie. In those countries which are but little developed, industrially and  
commercially, these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising bourgeoisie.

In countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of petty  
bourgeois has been formed, fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie, and ever renewing  
itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society. The individual members of this class,  
however, are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition, and,  
as modern industry develops, they even see the moment approaching when they will completely  
disappear as an independent section of modern society, to be replaced in manufactures,  
agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen.

In countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more than half of the population, it  
was natural that writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use, in  
their criticism of the bourgeois régime, the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois, and  
from the standpoint of these intermediate classes, should take up the cudgels for the working  
class. Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism. Sismondi was the head of this school, not only in  
France but also in England.

This school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions in the conditions of  
modern production. It laid bare the hypocritical apologies of economists. It proved,  
incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour; the concentration of  
capital and land in a few hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed out the inevitable ruin of  
the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery of the proletariat, the anarchy in production, the  
crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war of extermination between  
nations, the dissolution of old moral bonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities.

In its positive aims, however, this form of Socialism aspires either to restoring the old means of  
production and of exchange, and with them the old property relations, and the old society, or to  
cramping the modern means of production and of exchange within the framework of the old  
property relations that have been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means. In either  
case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.

Its last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture; patriarchal relations in agriculture.

Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of self-  
deception, this form of Socialism ended in a miserable hangover.

###### C. German or “True” Socialism

The Socialist and Communist literature of France, a literature that originated under the pressure  
of a bourgeoisie in power, and that was the expressions of the struggle against this power, was  
introduced into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie, in that country, had just begun its  
contest with feudal absolutism.

German philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits, eagerly seized on this  
literature, only forgetting, that when these writings immigrated from France into Germany,  
French social conditions had not immigrated along with them. In contact with German social  
conditions, this French literature lost all its immediate practical significance and assumed a  
purely literary aspect. Thus, to the German philosophers of the Eighteenth Century, the demands  
of the first French Revolution were nothing more than the demands of “Practical Reason” in  
general, and the utterance of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie signified, in their  
eyes, the laws of pure Will, of Will as it was bound to be, of true human Will generally.

The work of the German literati consisted solely in bringing the new French ideas into harmony  
with their ancient philosophical conscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without  
deserting their own philosophic point of view.

This annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign language is appropriated,  
namely, by translation.

It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic Saints over the manuscripts on  
which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been written. The German literati reversed  
this process with the profane French literature. They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath  
the French original. For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic functions of

14 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

money, they wrote “Alienation of Humanity,” and beneath the French criticism of the bourgeois  
state they wrote “Dethronement of the Category of the General,” and so forth.

The introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of the French historical criticisms,  
they dubbed “Philosophy of Action,” “True Socialism,” “German Science of Socialism,”  
“Philosophical Foundation of Socialism,” and so on.

The French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely emasculated. And, since it  
ceased in the hands of the German to express the struggle of one class with the other, he felt  
conscious of having overcome “French one-sidedness” and of representing, not true  
requirements, but the requirements of Truth; not the interests of the proletariat, but the interests  
of Human Nature, of Man in general, who belongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in  
the misty realm of philosophical fantasy.

This German socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously and solemnly, and extolled  
its poor stock-in-trade in such a mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic  
innocence.

The fight of the Germans, and especially of the Prussian bourgeoisie, against feudal aristocracy  
and absolute monarchy, in other words, the liberal movement, became more earnest.

By this, the long-wished for opportunity was offered to “True” Socialism of confronting the  
political movement with the Socialist demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas against  
liberalism, against representative government, against bourgeois competition, bourgeois  
freedom of the press, bourgeois legislation, bourgeois liberty and equality, and of preaching to  
the masses that they had nothing to gain, and everything to lose, by this bourgeois movement.  
German Socialism forgot, in the nick of time, that the French criticism, whose silly echo it was,  
presupposed the existence of modern bourgeois society, with its corresponding economic  
conditions of existence, and the political constitution adapted thereto, the very things those  
attainment was the object of the pending struggle in Germany.

To the absolute governments, with their following of parsons, professors, country squires, and  
officials, it served as a welcome scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie.

It was a sweet finish, after the bitter pills of flogging and bullets, with which these same  
governments, just at that time, dosed the German working-class risings.

While this “True” Socialism thus served the government as a weapon for fighting the German  
bourgeoisie, it, at the same time, directly represented a reactionary interest, the interest of  
German Philistines. In Germany, the petty-bourgeois class, a relic of the sixteenth century, and  
since then constantly cropping up again under the various forms, is the real social basis of the  
existing state of things.

To preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany. The industrial and  
political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction – on the one hand,  
from the concentration of capital; on the other, from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat.  
“True” Socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone. It spread like an epidemic.

The robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of  
sickly sentiment, this transcendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their sorry  
“eternal truths,” all skin and bone, served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods  
amongst such a public.

And on its part German Socialism recognised, more and more, its own calling as the bombastic  
representative of the petty-bourgeois Philistine.

It proclaimed the German nation to be the model nation, and the German petty Philistine to be  
the typical man. To every villainous meanness of this model man, it gave a hidden, higher,  
Socialistic interpretation, the exact contrary of its real character. It went to the extreme length of  
directly opposing the “brutally destructive” tendency of Communism, and of proclaiming its  
supreme and impartial contempt of all class struggles. With very few exceptions, all the so-  
called Socialist and Communist publications that now (1847) circulate in Germany belong to the  
domain of this foul and enervating literature.

The Communist Manifesto 15

##### 2. Conservative or Bourgeois Socialism

A part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances in order to secure the  
continued existence of bourgeois society.

To this section belong economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers of the condition of  
the working class, organisers of charity, members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to  
animals, temperance fanatics, hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind. This form of  
socialism has, moreover, been worked out into complete systems.

We may cite Proudhon’s Philosophis de la Misère as an example of this form.

The Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the  
struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom. They desire the existing state of society,  
minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements. They wish for a bourgeoisie without a  
proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best;  
and bourgeois Socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more or less  
complete systems. In requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system, and thereby to march  
straightway into the social New Jerusalem, it but requires in reality, that the proletariat should  
remain within the bounds of existing society, but should cast away all its hateful ideas  
concerning the bourgeoisie.

A second, and more practical, but less systematic, form of this Socialism sought to depreciate  
every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class by showing that no mere  
political reform, but only a change in the material conditions of existence, in economical  
relations, could be of any advantage to them. By changes in the material conditions of existence,  
this form of Socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations  
of production, an abolition that can be affected only by a revolution, but administrative reforms,  
based on the continued existence of these relations; reforms, therefore, that in no respect affect  
the relations between capital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and simplify the  
administrative work, of bourgeois government.

Bourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression when, and only when, it becomes a mere figure  
of speech.

Free trade: for the benefit of the working class. Protective duties: for the benefit of the working  
class. Prison Reform: for the benefit of the working class. This is the last word and the only  
seriously meant word of bourgeois socialism.

It is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois – for the benefit of the working  
class.

##### 3. Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism

We do not here refer to that literature which, in every great modern revolution, has always given  
voice to the demands of the proletariat, such as the writings of Babeuf and others.

The first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends, made in times of universal  
excitement, when feudal society was being overthrown, necessarily failed, owing to the then  
undeveloped state of the proletariat, as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its  
emancipation, conditions that had yet to be produced, and could be produced by the impending  
bourgeois epoch alone. The revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of  
the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character. It inculcated universal asceticism and  
social levelling in its crudest form.

The Socialist and Communist systems, properly so called, those of Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen,  
and others, spring into existence in the early undeveloped period, described above, of the  
struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie.

The founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as well as the action of the  
decomposing elements in the prevailing form of society. But the proletariat, as yet in its infancy,  
offers to them the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any independent  
political movement.

Since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the development of industry,  
the economic situation, as they find it, does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for

16 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

the emancipation of the proletariat. They therefore search after a new social science, after new  
social laws, that are to create these conditions.

Historical action is to yield to their personal inventive action; historically created conditions of  
emancipation to fantastic ones; and the gradual, spontaneous class organisation of the proletariat  
to an organisation of society especially contrived by these inventors. Future history resolves  
itself, in their eyes, into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social plans.

In the formation of their plans, they are conscious of caring chiefly for the interests of the  
working class, as being the most suffering class. Only from the point of view of being the most  
suffering class does the proletariat exist for them.

The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own surroundings, causes Socialists  
of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve  
the condition of every member of society, even that of the most favoured. Hence, they  
habitually appeal to society at large, without the distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the  
ruling class. For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail to see in it the  
best possible plan of the best possible state of society?

Hence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary action; they wish to attain their  
ends by peaceful means, necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the  
way for the new social Gospel.

Such fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time when the proletariat is still in a very  
undeveloped state and has but a fantastic conception of its own position, correspond with the  
first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of society.

But these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a critical element. They attack  
every principle of existing society. Hence, they are full of the most valuable materials for the  
enlightenment of the working class. The practical measures proposed in them – such as the  
abolition of the distinction between town and country, of the family, of the carrying on of  
industries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage system, the proclamation of  
social harmony, the conversion of the function of the state into a more superintendence of  
production – all these proposals point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms which  
were, at that time, only just cropping up, and which, in these publications, are recognised in  
their earliest indistinct and undefined forms only. These proposals, therefore, are of a purely  
Utopian character.

The significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism bears an inverse relation to  
historical development. In proportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes definite  
shape, this fantastic standing apart from the contest, these fantastic attacks on it, lose all  
practical value and all theoretical justification. Therefore, although the originators of these  
systems were, in many respects, revolutionary, their disciples have, in every case, formed mere  
reactionary sects. They hold fast by the original views of their masters, in opposition to the  
progressive historical development of the proletariat. They, therefore, endeavour, and that  
consistently, to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms. They still  
dream of experimental realisation of their social Utopias, of founding isolated “phalansteres,” of  
establishing “Home Colonies,” or setting up a “Little Icaria” – duodecimo editions of the New  
Jerusalem – and to realise all these castles in the air, they are compelled to appeal to the feelings  
and purses of the bourgeois. By degrees, they sink into the category of the reactionary [or]  
conservative Socialists depicted above, differing from these only by more systematic pedantry,  
and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous effects of their social science.

They, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the part of the working class; such  
action, according to them, can only result from blind unbelief in the new Gospel.

The Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France, respectively, oppose the Chartists and  
the Réformistes.

#### IV. Position of the Communists in Relation

#### to the Various Existing Opposition Parties

Section II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the existing working-class parties,  
such as the Chartists in England and the Agrarian Reformers in America.

The Communist Manifesto 17

The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the  
momentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also  
represent and take care of the future of that movement. In France, the Communists ally with the  
Social-Democrats against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the right  
to take up a critical position in regard to phases and illusions traditionally handed down from the  
great Revolution.

In Switzerland, they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this party consists  
of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical  
bourgeois.

In Poland, they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for  
national emancipation, that party which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.

In Germany, they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the  
absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.

But they never cease, for a single instant, to instil into the working class the clearest possible  
recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the  
German workers may straightway use, as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the social  
and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its  
supremacy, and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in Germany, the fight  
against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin.

The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a  
bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of  
European civilisation and with a much more developed proletariat than that of England was in  
the seventeenth, and France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in  
Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution.

In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the  
existing social and political order of things. In all these movements, they bring to the front, as  
the leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at  
the time. Finally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties  
of all countries.

The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends  
can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling  
classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their  
chains. They have a world to win.

Working Men of All Countries, Unite!

## The Paris Commune

## Address to the International Workingmen’s Association, May 1871

On the dawn of March 18, Paris arose to the thunder-burst of “Vive la Commune!” What is the  
Commune, that sphinx so tantalizing to the bourgeois mind?

“The proletarians of Paris,” said the Central Committee in its manifesto of March 18, “amidst  
the failures and treasons of the ruling classes, have understood that the hour has struck for them  
to save the situation by taking into their own hands the direction of public affairs.... They have  
understood that it is their imperious duty, and their absolute right, to render themselves masters  
of their own destinies, by seizing upon the governmental power.”

But the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and  
wield it for its own purposes.

The centralized state power, with its ubiquitous organs of standing army, police, bureaucracy,  
clergy, and judicature – organs wrought after the plan of a systematic and hierarchic division of  
labor – originates from the days of absolute monarchy, serving nascent bourgeois society as a  
mighty weapon in its struggle against feudalism. Still, its development remained clogged by all  
manner of medieval rubbish, seignorial rights, local privileges, municipal and guild monopolies,  
and provincial constitutions. The gigantic broom of the French Revolution of the 18th century  
swept away all these relics of bygone times, thus clearing simultaneously the social soil of its  
last hindrances to the superstructure of the modern state edifice raised under the First Empire,  
itself the offspring of the coalition wars of old semi-feudal Europe against modern France.

During the subsequent regimes, the government, placed under parliamentary control – that is,  
under the direct control of the propertied classes – became not only a hotbed of huge national  
debts and crushing taxes; with its irresistible allurements of place, pelf, and patronage, it became  
not only the bone of contention between the rival factions and adventurers of the ruling classes;  
but its political character changed simultaneously with the economic changes of society. At the  
same pace at which the progress of modern industry developed, widened, intensified the class  
antagonism between capital and labor, the state power assumed more and more the character of  
the national power of capital over labor, of a public force organized for social enslavement, of  
an engine of class despotism.

After every revolution marking a progressive phase in the class struggle, the purely repressive  
character of the state power stands out in bolder and bolder relief. The Revolution of 1830,  
resulting in the transfer of government from the landlords to the capitalists, transferred it from  
the more remote to the more direct antagonists of the working men. The bourgeois republicans,  
who, in the name of the February Revolution, took the state power, used it for the June [1848]  
massacres, in order to convince the working class that “social” republic means the republic  
entrusting their social subjection, and in order to convince the royalist bulk of the bourgeois and  
landlord class that they might safely leave the cares and emoluments of government to the  
bourgeois “republicans.”

However, after their one heroic exploit of June, the bourgeois republicans had, from the front, to  
fall back to the rear of the “Party of Order” – a combination formed by all the rival fractions and  
factions of the appropriating classes. The proper form of their joint-stock government was the  
parliamentary republic, with Louis Bonaparte for its president. Theirs was a regime of avowed  
class terrorism and deliberate insult towards the “vile multitude.”

If the parliamentary republic, as M. Thiers said, “divided them [the different fractions of the  
ruling class] least,” it opened an abyss between that class and the whole body of society outside  
their spare ranks. The restraints by which their own divisions had under former regimes still  
checked the state power, were removed by their union; and in view of the threatening upheaval  
of the proletariat, they now used that state power mercilessly and ostentatiously as the national  
war engine of capital against labor.

In their uninterrupted crusade against the producing masses, they were, however, bound not  
only to invest the executive with continually increased powers of repression, but at the same  
time to divest their own parliamentary stronghold – the National Assembly – one by one, of all

The Paris Commune 19

its own means of defence against the Executive. The Executive, in the person of Louis  
Bonaparte, turned them out. The natural offspring of the “Party of Order” republic was the  
Second Empire.

The empire, with the coup d’état for its birth certificate, universal suffrage for its sanction, and  
the sword for its sceptre, professed to rest upon the peasantry, the large mass of producers not  
directly involved in the struggle of capital and labor. It professed to save the working class by  
breaking down parliamentarism, and, with it, the undisguised subserviency of government to the  
propertied classes. It professed to save the propertied classes by upholding their economic  
supremacy over the working class; and, finally, it professed to unite all classes by reviving for  
all the chimera of national glory.

In reality, it was the only form of government possible at a time when the bourgeoisie had  
already lost, and the working class had not yet acquired, the faculty of ruling the nation. It was  
acclaimed throughout the world as the savior of society. Under its sway, bourgeois society,  
freed from political cares, attained a development unexpected even by itself. Its industry and  
commerce expanded to colossal dimensions; financial swindling celebrated cosmopolitan  
orgies; the misery of the masses was set off by a shameless display of gorgeous, meretricious  
and debased luxury. The state power, apparently soaring high above society and the very hotbed  
of all its corruptions. Its own rottenness, and the rottenness of the society it had saved, were laid  
bare by the bayonet of Prussia, herself eagerly bent upon transferring the supreme seat of that  
regime from Paris to Berlin. Imperialism is, at the same time, the most prostitute and the  
ultimate form of the state power which nascent bourgeois society had commenced to elaborate  
as a means of its own emancipation from feudalism, and which full-grown bourgeois society  
had finally transformed into a means for the enslavement of labor by capital.

The direct antithesis to the empire was the Commune. The cry of “social republic,” with which  
the February [1848] Revolution was ushered in by the Paris proletariat, did but express a vague  
aspiration after a republic that was not only to supercede the monarchical form of class rule, but  
class rule itself. The Commune was the positive form of that republic.

Paris, the central seat of the old governmental power, and, at the same time, the social  
stronghold of the French working class, had risen in arms against the attempt of Thiers and the  
Rurals to restore and perpetuate that old governmental power bequeathed to them by the empire.  
Paris could resist only because, in consequence of the siege, it had got rid of the army, and  
replaced it by a National Guard, the bulk of which consisted of working men. This fact was now  
to be transformed into an institution. The first decree of the Commune, therefore, was the  
suppression of the standing army, and the substitution for it of the armed people.

The Commune was formed of the municipal councillors, chosen by universal suffrage in the  
various wards of the town, responsible and revocable at short terms. The majority of its  
members were naturally working men, or acknowledged representatives of the working class.  
The Commune was to be a working, not a parliamentary body, executive and legislative at the  
same time.

Instead of continuing to be the agent of the Central Government, the police was at once stripped  
of its political attributes, and turned into the responsible, and at all times revocable, agent of the  
Commune. So were the officials of all other branches of the administration. From the members  
of the Commune downwards, the public service had to be done at workman’s wage. The vested  
interests and the representation allowances of the high dignitaries of state disappeared along  
with the high dignitaries themselves. Public functions ceased to be the private property of the  
tools of the Central Government. Not only municipal administration, but the whole initiative  
hitherto exercised by the state was laid into the hands of the Commune.

Having once got rid of the standing army and the police – the physical force elements of the old  
government – the Commune was anxious to break the spiritual force of repression, the “parson-  
power,” by the disestablishment and disendowment of all churches as proprietary bodies. The  
priests were sent back to the recesses of private life, there to feed upon the alms of the faithful in  
imitation of their predecessors, the apostles.

The whole of the educational institutions were opened to the people gratuitously, and at the  
same time cleared of all interference of church and state. Thus, not only was education made

20 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

accessible to all, but science itself freed from the fetters which class prejudice and governmental  
force had imposed upon it.

The judicial functionaries were to be divested of that sham independence which had but served  
to mask their abject subserviency to all succeeding governments to which, in turn, they had  
taken, and broken, the oaths of allegiance. Like the rest of public servants, magistrates and  
judges were to be elective, responsible, and revocable.

The Paris Commune was, of course, to serve as a model to all the great industrial centres of  
France. The communal regime once established in Paris and the secondary centres, the old  
centralized government would in the provinces, too, have to give way to the self-government of  
the producers.

In a rough sketch of national organization, which the Commune had no time to develop, it states  
clearly that the Commune was to be the political form of even the smallest country hamlet, and  
that in the rural districts the standing army was to be replaced by a national militia, with an  
extremely short term of service. The rural communities of every district were to administer their  
common affairs by an assembly of delegates in the central town, and these district assemblies  
were again to send deputies to the National Delegation in Paris, each delegate to be at any time  
revocable and bound by the mandat imperatif (formal instructions) of his constituents. The few  
but important functions which would still remain for a central government were not to be  
suppressed, as has been intentionally misstated, but were to be discharged by Communal and  
thereafter responsible agents.

The unity of the nation was not to be broken, but, on the contrary, to be organized by Communal  
Constitution, and to become a reality by the destruction of the state power which claimed to be  
the embodiment of that unity independent of, and superior to, the nation itself, from which it  
was but a parasitic excrescence.

While the merely repressive organs of the old governmental power were to be amputated, its  
legitimate functions were to be wrested from an authority usurping pre-eminence over society  
itself, and restored to the responsible agents of society. Instead of deciding once in three or six  
years which member of the ruling class was to misrepresent the people in Parliament, universal  
suffrage was to serve the people, constituted in Communes, as individual suffrage serves every  
other employer in the search for the workmen and managers in his business. And it is well-  
known that companies, like individuals, in matters of real business generally know how to put  
the right man in the right place, and, if they for once make a mistake, to redress it promptly. On  
the other hand, nothing could be more foreign to the spirit of the Commune than to supercede  
universal suffrage by hierarchical investiture.

It is generally the fate of completely new historical creations to be mistaken for the counterparts  
of older, and even defunct, forms of social life, to which they may bear a certain likeness. Thus,  
this new Commune, which breaks with the modern state power, has been mistaken for a  
reproduction of the medieval Communes, which first preceded, and afterward became the  
substratum of, that very state power. The Communal Constitution has been mistaken for an  
attempt to break up into the federation of small states, as dreamt of by Montesquieu and the  
Girondins, that unity of great nations which, if originally brought about by political force, has  
now become a powerful coefficient of social production. The antagonism of the Commune  
against the state power has been mistaken for an exaggerated form of the ancient struggle  
against over-centralization. Peculiar historical circumstances may have prevented the classical  
development, as in France, of the bourgeois form of government, and may have allowed, as in  
England, to complete the great central state organs by corrupt vestries, jobbing councillors, and  
ferocious poor-law guardians in the towns, and virtually hereditary magistrates in the counties.

The Communal Constitution would have restored to the social body all the forces hitherto  
absorbed by the state parasite feeding upon, and clogging the free movement of, society. By this  
one act, it would have initiated the regeneration of France.

The provincial French bourgeois saw in the Commune an attempt to restore the sway their order  
had held over the country under Louis Philippe, and which, under Louis Napoleon, was  
supplanted by the pretended rule of the country over the towns. In reality, the Communal  
Constitution brought the rural producers under the intellectual lead of the central towns of their  
districts, and there secured to them, in the working men, the natural trustees of their interests.

The Paris Commune 21

The very existence of the Commune involved, as a matter of course, local municipal liberty, but  
no longer as a check upon the now superseded state power. It could only enter into the head of a  
Bismarck – who, when not engaged on his intrigues of blood and iron, always likes to resume  
his old trade, so befitting his mental calibre, of contributor to Kladderadatsch (the Berlin  
Punch) – it could only enter into such a head to ascribe to the Paris Commune aspirations after  
the caricature of the old French municipal organization of 1791, the Prussian municipal  
constitution which degrades the town governments to mere secondary wheels in the police  
machinery of the Prussian state. The Commune made that catchword of bourgeois revolutions –  
cheap government – a reality by destroying the two greatest sources of expenditure: the standing  
army and state functionarism. Its very existence presupposed the non-existence of monarchy,  
which, in Europe at least, is the normal encumbrance and indispensable cloak of class rule. It  
supplied the republic with the basis of really democratic institutions. But neither cheap  
government nor the “true republic” was its ultimate aim; they were its mere concomitants.

The multiplicity of interpretations to which the Commune has been subjected, and the  
multiplicity of interests which construed it in their favor, show that it was a thoroughly  
expansive political form, while all the previous forms of government had been emphatically  
repressive. Its true secret was this: It was essentially a working class government, the product of  
the struggle of the producing against the appropriating class, the political form at last discovered  
under which to work out the economical emancipation of labor.

Except on this last condition, the Communal Constitution would have been an impossibility and  
a delusion. The political rule of the producer cannot co-exist with the perpetuation of his social  
slavery. The Commune was therefore to serve as a lever for uprooting the economical  
foundation upon which rests the existence of classes, and therefore of class rule. With labor  
emancipated, every man becomes a working man, and productive labor ceases to be a class  
attribute.

It is a strange fact. In spite of all the tall talk and all the immense literature, for the last 60 years,  
about emancipation of labor, no sooner do the working men anywhere take the subject into their  
own hands with a will, than uprises at once all the apologetic phraseology of the mouthpieces of  
present society with its two poles of capital and wage-slavery (the landlord now is but the  
sleeping partner of the capitalist), as if the capitalist society was still in its purest state of virgin  
innocence, with its antagonisms still undeveloped, with its delusions still unexploded, with its  
prostitute realities not yet laid bare. The Commune, they exclaim, intends to abolish property,  
the basis of all civilization!

Yes, gentlemen, the Commune intended to abolish that class property which makes the labor of  
the many the wealth of the few. It aimed at the expropriation of the expropriators. It wanted to  
make individual property a truth by transforming the means of production, land, and capital,  
now chiefly the means of enslaving and exploiting labor, into mere instruments of free and  
associated labor. But this is communism, “impossible” communism! Why, those member of the  
ruling classes who are intelligent enough to perceive the impossibility of continuing the present  
system – and they are many – have become the obtrusive and full-mouthed apostles of co-  
operative production. If co-operative production is not to remain a sham and a snare; if it is to  
supersede the capitalist system; if united co-operative societies are to regulate national  
production upon common plan, thus taking it under their own control, and putting an end to the  
constant anarchy and periodical convulsions which are the fatality of capitalist production –  
what else, gentlemen, would it be but communism, “possible” communism?

The working class did not expect miracles from the Commune. They have no ready-made  
utopias to introduce par decret du peuple. They know that in order to work out their own  
emancipation, and along with it that higher form to which present society is irresistibly tending  
by its own economical agencies, they will have to pass through long struggles, through a series  
of historic processes, transforming circumstances and men. They have no ideals to realize, but to  
set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsing bourgeois society itself is  
pregnant. In the full consciousness of their historic mission, and with the heroic resolve to act up  
to it, the working class can afford to smile at the coarse invective of the gentlemen’s gentlemen  
with pen and inkhorn, and at the didactic patronage of well-wishing bourgeois-doctrinaires,  
pouring forth their ignorant platitudes and sectarian crotchets in the oracular tone of scientific  
infallibility.

22 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

When the Paris Commune took the management of the revolution in its own hands; when plain  
working men for the first time dared to infringe upon the governmental privilege of their  
“natural superiors,” and, under circumstances of unexampled difficulty, performed it at salaries  
the highest of which barely amounted to one-fifth what, according to high scientific authority, is  
the minimum required for a secretary to a certain metropolitan school-board – the old world  
writhed in convulsions of rage at the sight of the Red Flag, the symbol of the Republic of Labor,  
floating over the Hotel de Ville.

And yet, this was the first revolution in which the working class was openly acknowledged as  
the only class capable of social initiative, even by the great bulk of the Paris bourgeois –  
shopkeepers, tradesmen, merchants – the wealthy capitalist alone excepted. The Commune had  
saved them by a sagacious settlement of that ever recurring cause of dispute among the  
bourgeois themselves – the debtor and creditor accounts. The same portion of the bourgeois,  
after they had assisted in putting down the working men’s insurrection of June 1848, had been at  
once unceremoniously sacrificed to their creditors by the then Constituent Assembly. But this  
was not their only motive for now rallying around the working class. They felt there was but one  
alternative – the Commune, or the empire – under whatever name it might reappear. The empire  
had ruined them economically by the havoc it made of public wealth, by the wholesale financial  
swindling it fostered, by the props it lent to the artificially accelerated centralization of capital,  
and the concomitant expropriation of their own ranks. It had suppressed them politically, it had  
shocked them morally by its orgies, it had insulted their Voltairianism by handing over the  
education of their children to the fréres Ignorantins, it had revolted their national feeling as  
Frenchmen by precipitating them headlong into a war which left only one equivalent for the  
ruins it made – the disappearance of the empire. In fact, after the exodus from Paris of the high  
Bonapartist and capitalist boheme, the true bourgeois Party of Order came out in the shape of  
the “Union Republicaine,” enrolling themselves under the colors of the Commune and  
defending it against the wilful misconstructions of Thiers. Whether the gratitude of this great  
body of the bourgeois will stand the present severe trial, time must show.

The Commune was perfectly right in telling the peasants that “its victory was their only hope.”  
Of all the lies hatched at Versailles and re-echoed by the glorious European penny-a-liner, one  
of the most tremendous was that the Rurals represented the French peasantry. Think only of the  
love of the French peasant for the men to whom, after 1815, he had to pay the milliard  
indemnity. In the eyes of the French peasant, the very existence of a great landed proprietor is in  
itself an encroachment on his conquests of 1789. The bourgeois, in 1848, had burdened his plot  
of land with the additional tax of 45 cents, in the franc; but then he did so in the name of the  
revolution; while now he had fomented a civil war against revolution, to shift on to the peasant’s  
shoulders the chief load of the 5 milliards of indemnity to be paid to the Prussian. The  
Commune, on the other hand, in one of its first proclamations, declared that the true originators  
of the war would be made to pay its cost. The Commune would have delivered the peasant of  
the blood tax – would have given him a cheap government – transformed his present blood-  
suckers, the notary, advocate, executor, and other judicial vampires, into salaried communal  
agents, elected by, and responsible to, himself. It would have freed him of the tyranny of the  
garde champetre, the gendarme, and the prefect; would have put enlightenment by the  
schoolmaster in the place of stultification by the priest. And the French peasant is, above all, a  
man of reckoning. He would find it extremely reasonable that the pay of the priest, instead of  
being extorted by the tax-gatherer, should only depend upon the spontaneous action of the  
parishioners’ religious instinct. Such were the great immediate boons which the rule of the  
Commune – and that rule alone – held out to the French peasantry. It is, therefore, quite  
superfluous here to expatiate upon the more complicated but vital problems which the  
Commune alone was able, and at the same time compelled, to solve in favor of the peasant –  
viz., the hypothecary debt, lying like an incubus upon his parcel of soil, the prolétariat foncier  
(the rural proletariat), daily growing upon it, and his expropriation from it enforced, at a more  
and more rapid rate, by the very development of modern agriculture and the competition of  
capitalist farming.

The French peasant had elected Louis Bonaparte president of the republic; but the Party of  
Order created the empire. What the French peasant really wants he commenced to show in 1849  
and 1850, by opposing his maire to the government’s prefect, his school-master to the

The Paris Commune 23

government’s priest, and himself to the government’s gendarme. All the laws made by the Party  
of Order in January and February 1850 were avowed measures of repression against the peasant.  
The peasant was a Bonapartist, because the Great Revolution, with all its benefits to him, was,  
in his eyes, personified in Napoleon. This delusion, rapidly breaking down under the Second  
Empire (and in its very nature hostile to the Rurals), this prejudice of the past, how could it have  
withstood the appeal of the Commune to the living interests and urgent wants of the peasantry?

The Rurals – this was, in fact, their chief apprehension – knew that three months’ free  
communication of Communal Paris with the provinces would bring about a general rising of the  
peasants, and hence their anxiety to establish a police blockade around Paris, so as to stop the  
spread of the rinderpest [cattle pest – contagious disease].

If the Commune was thus the true representative of all the healthy elements of French society,  
and therefore the truly national government, it was, at the same time, as a working men’s  
government, as the bold champion of the emancipation of labor, emphatically international.  
Within sight of that Prussian army, that had annexed to Germany two French provinces, the  
Commune annexed to France the working people all over the world.

The Second Empire had been the jubilee of cosmopolitan blackleggism, the rakes of all  
countries rushing in at its call for a share in its orgies and in the plunder of the French people.  
Even at this moment, the right hand of Thiers is Ganessco, the foul Wallachian, and his left  
hand is Markovsky, the Russian spy. The Commune admitted all foreigners to the honor of  
dying for an immortal cause. Between the foreign war lost by their treason, and the civil war  
fomented by their conspiracy with the foreign invader, the bourgeoisie had found the time to  
display their patriotism by organizing police hunts upon the Germans in France. The Commune  
made a German working man [Leo Frankel] its Minister of Labor. Thiers, the bourgeoisie, the  
Second Empire, had continually deluded Poland by loud professions of sympathy, while in  
reality betraying her to, and doing the dirty work of, Russia. The Commune honoured the heroic  
sons of Poland [J. Dabrowski and W. Wróblewski] by placing them at the head of the defenders  
of Paris. And, to broadly mark the new era of history it was conscious of initiating, under the  
eyes of the conquering Prussians on one side, and the Bonapartist army, led by Bonapartist  
generals, on the other, the Commune pulled down that colossal symbol of martial glory, the  
Vendôme Column.

The great social measure of the Commune was its own working existence. Its special measures  
could but betoken the tendency of a government of the people by the people. Such were the  
abolition of the nightwork of journeymen bakers; the prohibition, under penalty, of the  
employers’ practice to reduce wages by levying upon their workpeople fines under manifold  
pretexts – a process in which the employer combines in his own person the parts of legislator,  
judge, and executor, and filches the money to boot. Another measure of this class was the  
surrender to associations of workmen, under reserve of compensation, of all closed workshops  
and factories, no matter whether the respective capitalists had absconded or preferred to strike  
work.

The financial measures of the Commune, remarkable for their sagacity and moderation, could  
only be such as were compatible with the state of a besieged town. Considering the colossal  
robberies committed upon the city of Paris by the great financial companies and contractors,  
under the protection of Haussman, the Commune would have had an incomparably better title to  
confiscate their property than Louis Napoleon had against the Orleans family. The Hohenzollern  
and the English oligarchs, who both have derived a good deal of their estates from church  
plunders, were, of course, greatly shocked at the Commune clearing but 8,000f out of  
secularization.

While the Versailles government, as soon as it had recovered some spirit and strength, used the  
most violent means against the Commune; while it put down the free expression of opinion all  
over France, even to the forbidding of meetings of delegates from the large towns; while it  
subjected Versailles and the rest of France to an espionage far surpassing that of the Second  
Empire; while it burned by its gendarme inquisitors all papers printed at Paris, and sifted all  
correspondence from and to Paris; while in the National Assembly the most timid attempts to  
put in a word for Paris were howled down in a manner unknown even to the Chambre  
introuvable of 1816; with the savage warfare of Versailles outside, and its attempts at corruption  
and conspiracy inside Paris – would the Commune not have shamefully betrayed its trust by

24 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

affecting to keep all the decencies and appearances of liberalism as in a time of profound peace?  
Had the government of the Commune been akin to that of M. Thiers, there would have been no  
more occasion to suppress Party of Order papers at Paris that there was to suppress Communal  
papers at Versailles.

It was irritating indeed to the Rurals that at the very same time they declared the return to the  
church to be the only means of salvation for France, the infidel Commune unearthed the  
peculiar mysteries of the Picpus nunnery, and of the Church of St. Laurent. It was a satire upon  
M. Thiers that, while he showered grand crosses upon the Bonapartist generals in  
acknowledgment of their mastery in losing battles, singing capitulations, and turning cigarettes  
at Wilhelmshöhe, the Commune dismissed and arrested its generals whenever they were  
suspected of neglecting their duties. The expulsion from, and arrest by, the Commune of one of  
its members [Blanchet] who had slipped in under a false name, and had undergone at Lyons six  
days’ imprisonment for simple bankruptcy, was it not a deliberate insult hurled at the forger,  
Jules Favre, then still the foreign minister of France, still selling France to Bismarck, and still  
dictating his orders to that paragon government of Belgium? But indeed the Commune did not  
pretend to infallibility, the invariable attribute of all governments of the old stamp. It published  
its doings and sayings, it initiated the public into all its shortcomings.

In every revolution there intrude, at the side of its true agents, men of different stamp; some of  
them survivors of and devotees to past revolutions, without insight into the present movement,  
but preserving popular influence by their known honesty and courage, or by the sheer force of  
tradition; others mere brawlers who, by dint of repeating year after year the same set of  
stereotyped declarations against the government of the day, have sneaked into the reputation of  
revolutionists of the first water. After March 18, some such men did also turn up, and in some  
cases contrived to play pre-eminent parts. As far as their power went, they hampered the real  
action of the working class, exactly as men of that sort have hampered the full development of  
every previous revolution. They are an unavoidable evil: with time they are shaken off; but time  
was not allowed to the Commune.

Wonderful, indeed, was the change the Commune had wrought in Paris! No longer any trace of  
the tawdry Paris of the Second Empire! No longer was Paris the rendezvous of British landlords,  
Irish absentees, American ex-slaveholders and shoddy men, Russian ex-serfowners, and  
Wallachian boyards. No more corpses at the morgue, no nocturnal burglaries, scarcely any  
robberies; in fact, for the first time since the days of February 1848, the streets of Paris were  
safe, and that without any police of any kind.

“We,” said a member of the Commune, “hear no longer of assassination, theft, and personal  
assault; it seems indeed as if the police had dragged along with it to Versailles all its  
Conservative friends.”

The cocottes had refound the scent of their protectors – the absconding men of family, religion,  
and, above all, of property. In their stead, the real women of Paris showed again at the surface –  
heroic, noble, and devoted, like the women of antiquity. Working, thinking fighting, bleeding  
Paris – almost forgetful, in its incubation of a new society, of the Cannibals at its gates – radiant  
in the enthusiasm of its historic initiative!

Opposed to this new world at Paris, behold the old world at Versailles – that assembly of the  
ghouls of all defunct regimes, Legitimists and Orleanists, eager to feed upon the carcass of the  
nation – with a tail of antediluvian republicans, sanctioning, by their presence in the Assembly,  
the slaveholders’ rebellion, relying for the maintenance of their parliamentary republic upon the  
vanity of the senile mountebank at its head, and caricaturing 1789 by holding their ghastly  
meetings in the Jeu de Paume. There it was, this Assembly, the representative of everything  
dead in France, propped up to the semblance of life by nothing but the swords of the generals of  
Louis Bonaparte. Paris all truth, Versailles all lie; and that lie vented through the mouth of  
Thiers.

Thiers tells a deputation of the mayors of the Seine-et-Oise – “You may rely upon my word,  
which I have never broken!”

He tells the Assembly itself that “it was the most freely elected and most liberal Assembly  
France ever possessed”; he tells his motley soldiery that it was “the admiration of the world, and  
the finest army France ever possessed”; he tells the provinces that the bombardment of Paris by

The Paris Commune 25

him was a myth: “If some cannon-shots have been fired, it was not the deed of the army of  
Versailles, but of some insurgents trying to make believe that they are fighting, while they dare  
not show their faces.” He again tells the provinces that “the artillery of Versailles does not  
bombard Paris, but only cannonades it.” He tells the Archbishop of Paris that the pretended  
executions and reprisals (!) attributed to the Versailles troops were all moonshine. He tells Paris  
that he was only anxious “to free it from the hideous tyrants who oppress it,” and that, in fact,  
the Paris of the Commune was “but a handful of criminals.”

The Paris of M. Thiers was not the real Paris of the “vile multitude,” but a phantom Paris, the  
Paris of the francs-fileurs, the Paris of the Boulevards, male and female – the rich, the capitalist,  
the gilded, the idle Paris, now thronging with its lackeys, its blacklegs, its literary bohome, and  
its cocottes at Versailles, Saint-Denis, Rueil, and Saint-Germain; considering the civil war but  
an agreeable diversion, eyeing the battle going on through telescopes, counting the rounds of  
cannon, swearing by their own honor and that of their prostitutes, that the performance was far  
better got up than it used to be at the Porte St. Martin. The men who fell were really dead; the  
cries of the wounded were cries in good earnest; and, besides, the whole thing was so intensely  
historical.

This is the Paris of M. Thiers, as the emigration of Coblenz was the France of M. de Calonne.

## Theses on Feuerbach

## (1845)

#### 1

The main defect of all hitherto-existing materialism – that of Feuerbach included – is that the  
Object, actuality, sensuousness, are conceived only in the form of the object, or of  
contemplation, but not as human sensuous activity, practice, not subjectively. Hence it happened  
that the active side, in opposition to materialism, was developed by idealism – but only  
abstractly, since, of course, idealism does not know real, sensuous activity as such. Feuerbach  
wants sensuous objects, differentiated from thought-objects, but he does not conceive human  
activity itself as objective activity. In The Essence of Christianity, he therefore regards the  
theoretical attitude as the only genuinely human attitude, while practice is conceived and  
defined only in its dirty-Jewish form of appearance. Hence he does not grasp the significance of  
‘revolutionary’, of ‘practical-critical’, activity.

#### 2

The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of  
theory but is a practical question. Man must prove the truth, i.e., the reality and power, the this-  
sidedness of his thinking, in practice. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking  
which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question.

#### 3

The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that,  
therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets  
that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence  
this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The  
coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change can be  
conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary practice.

#### 4

Feuerbach starts off from the fact of religious self-estrangement, of the duplication of the world  
into a religious, imaginary world, and a secular one. His work consists in resolving the religious  
world into its secular basis. He overlooks the fact that after completing this work, the chief thing  
still remains to be done. For the fact that the secular basis lifts off from itself and establishes  
itself in the clouds as an independent realm can only be explained by the inner strife and  
intrinsic contradictoriness of this secular basis. The latter must itself be understood in its  
contradiction and then, by the removal of the contradiction, revolutionised. Thus, for instance,  
once the earthly family is discovered to be the secret of the holy family, the former must itself  
be annihilated theoretically and practically.

#### 5

Feuerbach, not satisfied with abstract thinking, wants sensuous contemplation; but he does  
not conceive sensuousness as practical, human-sensuous activity.

#### 6

Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man. But the essence of man is no  
abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations.  
Feuerbach, who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence is hence obliged:

1.  To abstract from the historical process and to define the religious sentiment regarded by  
    itself, and to presuppose an abstract – isolated - human individual.
2.  The essence therefore can by him only be regarded as ‘species’, as an inner ‘dumb’  
    generality which unites many individuals only in a natural way.

Theses on Feuerbach 27

#### 7

Feuerbach consequently does not see that the ‘religious sentiment’ is itself a social product, and  
that the abstract individual that he analyses belongs in reality to a particular social form.

#### 8

All social life is essentially practical. All mysteries which lead theory to mysticism find their  
rational solution in human practice and in the comprehension of this practice.

#### 9

The highest point reached by contemplative materialism, that is, materialism which does not  
comprehend sensuousness as practical activity, is the contemplation of single individuals and of  
civil society.

#### 10

The standpoint of the old materialism is civil society; the standpoint of the new is human society  
or social humanity.

#### 11

Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.

#### Excerpt from “The German Ideology” §1

The premises from which we begin are not arbitrary ones, not dogmas, but real premises from  
which abstraction can only be made in the imagination. They are the real individuals, their  
activity and the material conditions under which they live, both those which they find already  
existing and those produced by their activity. These premises can thus be verified in a purely  
empirical way.

### From The Grundrisse: The method of political economy

When we consider a given country politico-economically, we begin with its population, its  
distribution among classes, town, country, the coast, the different branches of production, export  
and import, annual production and consumption, commodity prices etc.

It seems to be correct to begin with the real and the concrete, with the real precondition, thus to  
begin, in economics, with e.g. the population, which is the foundation and the subject of the  
entire social act of production. However, on closer examination this proves false. The  
population is an abstraction if I leave out, for example, the classes of which it is composed.  
These classes in turn are an empty phrase if I am not familiar with the elements on which they  
rest. E.g. wage labour, capital, etc. These latter in turn presuppose exchange, division of labour,  
prices, etc. For example, capital is nothing without wage labour, without value, money, price  
etc. Thus, if I were to begin with the population, this would be a chaotic conception  
[Vorstellung] of the whole, and I would then, by means of further determination, move  
analytically towards ever more simple concepts [Begriff], from the imagined concrete towards  
ever thinner abstractions until I had arrived at the simplest determinations. From there the  
journey would have to be retraced until I had finally arrived at the population again, but this  
time not as the chaotic conception of a whole, but as a rich totality of many determinations and  
relations. The former is the path historically followed by economics at the time of its origins.  
The economists of the seventeenth century, e.g., always begin with the living whole, with  
population, nation, state, several states, etc.; but they always conclude by discovering through  
analysis a small number of determinant, abstract, general relations such as division of labour,  
money, value, etc. As soon as these individual moments had been more or less firmly  
established and abstracted, there began the economic systems, which ascended from the simple  
relations, such as labour, division of labour, need, exchange value, to the level of the state,  
exchange between nations and the world market. The latter is obviously the scientifically correct  
method. The concrete is concrete because it is the concentration of many determinations, hence  
unity of the diverse. It appears in the process of thinking, therefore, as a process of  
concentration, as a result, not as a point of departure, even though it is the point of departure in  
reality and hence also the point of departure for observation [Anschauung] and conception.  
Along the first path the full conception was evaporated to yield an abstract determination; along  
the second, the abstract determinations lead towards a reproduction of the concrete by way of  
thought. In this way Hegel fell into the illusion of conceiving the real as the product of thought  
concentrating itself, probing its own depths, and unfolding itself out of itself, by itself, whereas  
the method of rising from the abstract to the concrete is only the way in which thought  
appropriates the concrete, reproduces it as the concrete in the mind. But this is by no means the  
process by which the concrete itself comes into being. For example, the simplest economic  
category, say e.g. exchange value, presupposes population, moreover a population producing in  
specific relations; as well as a certain kind of family, or commune, or state, etc. It can never  
exist other than as an abstract, one-sided relation within an already given, concrete, living  
whole. As a category, by contrast, exchange value leads an antediluvian existence. Therefore, to  
the kind of consciousness – and this is characteristic of the philosophical consciousness – for  
which conceptual thinking is the real human being, and for which the conceptual world as such  
is thus the only reality, the movement of the categories appears as the real act of production –  
which only, unfortunately, receives a jolt from the outside – whose product is the world; and –  
but this is again a tautology – this is correct in so far as the concrete totality is a totality of  
thoughts, concrete in thought, in fact a product of thinking and comprehending; but not in any  
way a product of the concept which thinks and generates itself outside or above observation and  
conception; a product, rather, of the working-up of observation and conception into concepts.  
The totality as it appears in the head, as a totality of thoughts, is a product of a thinking head,  
which appropriates the world in the only way it can, a way different from the artistic, religious,  
practical and mental appropriation of this world. The real subject retains its autonomous  
existence outside the head just as before; namely as long as the head’s conduct is merely  
speculative, merely theoretical. Hence, in the theoretical method, too, the subject, society, must  
always be kept in mind as the presupposition.

Preface to Critique of Political Economy 29

### Preface to “A Contribution to the Critique of

### Political Economy”

#### January 1859. Excerpt

... The general conclusion at which I arrived and which, once reached, became the guiding  
principle of my studies can be summarised as follows.

In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are  
independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the  
development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production  
constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and  
political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The  
mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and  
intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their  
social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the  
material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production  
or – this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the  
framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive  
forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes  
in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense  
superstructure.

In studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material  
transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the  
precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic – in short,  
ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as one  
does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period  
of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be  
explained from the contradictions of material life, from the conflict existing between the social  
forces of production and the relations of production. No social order is ever destroyed before all  
the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations  
of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have  
matured within the framework of the old society.

Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination  
will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution  
are already present or at least in the course of formation. In broad outline, the Asiatic, ancient,  
feudal and modern bourgeois modes of production may be designated as epochs marking  
progress in the economic development of society. The bourgeois mode of production is the last  
antagonistic form of the social process of production – antagonistic not in the sense of  
individual antagonism but of an antagonism that emanates from the individuals’ social  
conditions of existence – but the productive forces developing within bourgeois society create  
also the material conditions for a solution of this antagonism. The prehistory of human society  
accordingly closes with this social formation.

## Introduction to Critique of

## Hegel’s Philosophy of Right

## (February, 1844)

For Germany, the criticism of religion has been essentially completed, and the criticism of  
religion is the prerequisite of all criticism.

The profane existence of error is compromised as soon as its heavenly oratio pro aris et focis  
has been refuted. Man, who has found only the reflection of himself in the fantastic reality of  
heaven, where he sought a superman, will no longer feel disposed to find the mere appearance  
of himself, the non-man, where he seeks and must seek his true reality.

The foundation of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion does not make man.  
Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won  
through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting  
outside the world. Man is the world of man – state, society. This state and this society produce  
religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world.  
Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular  
form, its spiritual point d’honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement,  
and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the  
human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against  
religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is  
religion.

Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest  
against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless  
world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.

The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real  
happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to  
give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the  
criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.

Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to  
bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck  
the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and  
fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he  
will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves  
around man as long as he does not revolve around himself.

It is, therefore, the task of history, once the other-world of truth has vanished, to establish the  
truth of this world. It is the immediate task of philosophy, which is in the service of history, to  
unmask self-estrangement in its unholy forms once the holy form of human self-estrangement  
has been unmasked. Thus, the criticism of Heaven turns into the criticism of Earth, the criticism  
of religion into the criticism of law, and the criticism of theology into the criticism of politics.

The following exposition – a contribution to this undertaking – concerns itself not directly with  
the original but with a copy, with the German philosophy of the state and of law. The only  
reason for this is that it is concerned with Germany.

If we were to begin with the German status quo itself, the result – even if we were to do it in the  
only appropriate way, i.e., negatively – would still be an anachronism. Even the negation of our  
present political situation is a dusty fact in the historical junk room of modern nations. If I  
negate powdered pigtails, I am still left with unpowdered pigtails. If I negate the situation in  
Germany in 1843, then according to the French calendar I have barely reached 1789, much less  
the vital centre of our present age.

Indeed, German history prides itself on having travelled a road which no other nation in the  
whole of history has ever travelled before, or ever will again. We have shared the restorations of  
modern nations without ever having shared their revolutions. We have been restored, firstly,  
because other nations dared to make revolutions, and, secondly, because other nations suffered

Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right 31

counter-revolutions; on the one hand, because our masters were afraid, and, on the other,  
because they were not afraid. With our shepherds to the fore, we only once kept company with  
freedom, on the day of its internment.

One school of thought that legitimizes the infamy of today with the infamy of yesterday, a  
school that stigmatizes every cry of the serf against the knout as mere rebelliousness once the  
knout has aged a little and acquired a hereditary significance and a history, a school to which  
history shows nothing but its a posteriori, as did the God of Israel to his servant Moses, the  
historical school of law – this school would have invented German history were it not itself an  
invention of that history. A Shylock, but a cringing Shylock, that swears by its bond, its  
historical bond, its Christian-Germanic bond, for every pound of flesh cut from the heart of the  
people.

Good-natured enthusiasts, Germanomaniacs by extraction and free-thinkers by reflexion, on the  
contrary, seek our history of freedom beyond our history in the ancient Teutonic forests. But,  
what difference is there between the history of our freedom and the history of the boar’s  
freedom if it can be found only in the forests? Besides, it is common knowledge that the forest  
echoes back what you shout into it. So peace to the ancient Teutonic forests!

War on the German state of affairs! By all means! They are below the level of history, they are  
beneath any criticism, but they are still an object of criticism like the criminal who is below the  
level of humanity but still an object for the executioner. In the struggle against that state of  
affairs, criticism is no passion of the head, it is the head of passion. It is not a lancet, it is a  
weapon. Its object is its enemy, which it wants not to refute but to exterminate. For the spirit of  
that state of affairs is refuted. In itself, it is no object worthy of thought, it is an existence which  
is as despicable as it is despised. Criticism does not need to make things clear to itself as regards  
this object, for it has already settled accounts with it. It no longer assumes the quality of an end-  
in-itself, but only of a means. Its essential pathos is indignation, its essential work is  
denunciation.

It is a case of describing the dull reciprocal pressure of all social spheres one on another, a  
general inactive ill-humour, a limitedness which recognizes itself as much as it mistakes itself,  
within the frame of government system which, living on the preservation of all wretchedness, is  
itself nothing but wretchedness in office.

What a sight! This infinitely proceeding division of society into the most manifold races  
opposed to one another by petty antipathies, uneasy consciences, and brutal mediocrity, and  
which, precisely because of their reciprocal ambiguous and distrustful attitude, are all, without  
exception although with various formalities, treated by their rulers as conceded existences. And  
they must recognize and acknowledge as a concession of heaven the very fact that they are  
mastered, ruled, possessed! And, on the other side, are the rulers themselves, whose greatness is  
in inverse proportion to their number!

Criticism dealing with this content is criticism in a hand-to-hand fight, and in such a fight the  
point is not whether the opponent is a noble, equal, interesting opponent, the point is to strike  
him. The point is not to let the Germans have a minute for self-deception and resignation. The  
actual pressure must be made more pressing by adding to it consciousness of pressure, the  
shame must be made more shameful by publicizing it. Every sphere of German society must be  
shown as the partie honteuse of German society: these petrified relations must be forced to  
dance by singing their own tune to them! The people must be taught to be terrified at itself in  
order to give it courage. This will be fulfilling an imperative need of the German nation, and the  
needs of the nations are in themselves the ultimate reason for their satisfaction.

This struggle against the limited content of the German status quo cannot be without interest  
even for the modern nations, for the German status quo is the open completion of the ancien  
régime and the ancien régime is the concealed deficiency of the modern state. The struggle  
against the German political present is the struggle against the past of the modern nations, and  
they are still burdened with reminders of that past. It is instructive for them to see the ancien  
régime, which has been through its tragedy with them, playing its comedy as a German  
revenant. Tragic indeed was the pre-existing power of the world, and freedom, on the other  
hand, was a personal notion; in short, as long as it believed and had to believe in its own  
justification. As long as the ancien régime, as an existing world order, struggled against a world

32 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

that was only coming into being, there was on its side a historical error, not a personal one. That  
is why its downfall was tragic.

On the other hand, the present German regime, an anachronism, a flagrant contradiction of  
generally recognized axioms, the nothingness of the ancien régime exhibited to the world, only  
imagines that it believes in itself and demands that the world should imagine the same thing. If  
it believed in its own essence, would it try to hide that essence under the semblance of an alien  
essence and seek refuge in hypocrisy and sophism? The modern ancien régime is rather only the  
comedian of a world order whose true heroes are dead. History is thorough and goes through  
many phases when carrying an old form to the grave. The last phases of a world-historical form  
is its comedy. The gods of Greece, already tragically wounded to death in Aeschylus’s tragedy  
Prometheus Bound, had to re-die a comic death in Lucian’s Dialogues. Why this course of  
history? So that humanity should part with its past cheerfully. This cheerful historical destiny is  
what we vindicate for the political authorities of Germany.

Meanwhile, once modern politico-social reality itself is subjected to criticism, once criticism  
rises to truly human problems, it finds itself outside the German status quo, or else it would  
reach out for its object below its object. An example. The relation of industry, of the world of  
wealth generally, to the political world is one of the major problems of modern times. In what  
form is this problem beginning to engage the attention of the Germans? In the form of protective  
duties, of the prohibitive system, of national economy. Germanomania has passed out of man  
into matter, and thus one morning our cotton barons and iron heroes saw themselves turned into  
patriots. People are, therefore, beginning in Germany to acknowledge the sovereignty of  
monopoly on the inside through lending it sovereignty on the outside. People are, therefore, now  
about to begin, in Germany, what people in France and England are about to end. The old  
corrupt condition against which these countries are revolting in theory, and which they only bear  
as one bears chains, is greeted in Germany as the dawn of a beautiful future which still hardly  
dares to pass from crafty theory to the most ruthless practice. Whereas the problem in France  
and England is: Political economy, or the rule of society over wealth; in Germany, it is: National  
economy, or the mastery of private property over nationality. In France and England, then, it is  
a case of abolishing monopoly that has proceeded to its last consequences; in Germany, it is a  
case of proceeding to the last consequences of monopoly. There it is a case of solution, here as  
yet a case of collision. This is an adequate example of the German form of modern problems, an  
example of how our history, like a clumsy recruit, still has to do extra drill on things that are old  
and hackneyed in history.

If, therefore, the whole German development did not exceed the German political development,  
a German could at the most have the share in the problems-of-the-present that a Russian has.  
But, when the separate individual is not bound by the limitations of the nation, the nation as a  
whole is still less liberated by the liberation of one individual. The fact that Greece had a  
Scythian among its philosophers did not help the Scythians to make a single step towards Greek  
culture.

Luckily, we Germans are not Scythians.

As the ancient peoples went through their pre-history in imagination, in mythology, so we  
Germans have gone through our post-history in thought, in philosophy. We are philosophical  
contemporaries of the present without being its historical contemporaries. German philosophy is  
the ideal prolongation of German history. If therefore, instead of the oeuvres incompletes of our  
real history, we criticize the oeuvres posthumes of our ideal history, philosophy, our criticism is  
in the midst of the questions of which the present says: that is the question. What, in progressive  
nations, is a practical break with modern state conditions, is, in Germany, where even those  
conditions do not yet exist, at first a critical break with the philosophical reflexion of those  
conditions.

German philosophy of right and state is the only German history which is al pari with the  
official modern present. The German nation must therefore join this, its dream-history, to its  
present conditions and subject to criticism not only these existing conditions, but at the same  
time their abstract continuation. Its future cannot be limited either to the immediate negation of  
its real conditions of state and right, or to the immediate implementation of its ideal state and  
right conditions, for it has the immediate negation of its real conditions in its ideal conditions,  
and it has almost outlived the immediate implementation of its ideal conditions in the

Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right 33

contemplation of neighboring nations. Hence, it is with good reason that the practical political  
party in Germany demands the negation of philosophy.

It is wrong, not in its demand but in stopping at the demand, which it neither seriously  
implements nor can implement. It believes that it implements that negation by turning its back  
to philosophy and its head away from it and muttering a few trite and angry phrases about it.  
Owing to the limitation of its outlook, it does not include philosophy in the circle of German  
reality or it even fancies it is beneath German practice and the theories that serve it. You  
demand that real life embryos be made the starting-point, but you forget that the real life embryo  
of the German nation has grown so far only inside its cranium. In a word – You cannot abolish

###### [aufheben] philosophy without making it a reality.

The same mistake, but with the factors reversed, was made by the theoretical party originating  
from philosophy.

In the present struggle it saw only the critical struggle of philosophy against the German world;  
it did not give a thought to the fact that philosophy up to the present itself belongs to this world  
and is its completion, although an ideal one. Critical towards its counterpart, it was uncritical  
towards itself when, proceeding from the premises of philosophy, it either stopped at the results  
given by philosophy or passed off demands and results from somewhere else as immediate  
demands and results of philosophy – although these, provided they are justified, can be obtained  
only by the negation of philosophy up to the present, of philosophy as such. We reserve  
ourselves the right to a more detailed description of this section: It thought it could make

###### philosophy a reality without abolishing [aufzuheben] it.

The criticism of the German philosophy of state and right, which attained its most consistent,  
richest, and last formulation through Hegel, is both a critical analysis of the modern state and of  
the reality connected with it, and the resolute negation of the whole manner of the German  
consciousness in politics and right as practiced hereto, the most distinguished, most universal  
expression of which, raised to the level of science, is the speculative philosophy of right itself. If  
the speculative philosophy of right, that abstract extravagant thinking on the modern state, the  
reality of which remains a thing of the beyond, if only beyond the Rhine, was possible only in  
Germany, inversely the German thought-image of the modern state which makes abstraction of  
real man was possible only because and insofar as the modern state itself makes abstraction of  
real man, or satisfies the whole of man only in imagination. In politics, the Germans thought  
what other nations did. Germany was their theoretical conscience. The abstraction and  
presumption of its thought was always in step with the one-sidedness and lowliness of its  
reality. If, therefore, the status quo of German statehood expresses the completion of the ancien  
régime, the completion of the thorn in the flesh of the modern state, the status quo of German  
state science expresses the incompletion of the modern state, the defectiveness of its flesh itself.

Already as the resolute opponent of the previous form of German political consciousness the  
criticism of speculative philosophy of right strays, not into itself, but into problems which there  
is only one means of solving – practice.

It is asked: can Germany attain a practice à la hauteur des principles – i.e., a revolution which  
will raise it not only to the official level of modern nations, but to the height of humanity which  
will be the near future of those nations?

The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace criticism of the weapon, material force must  
be overthrown by material force; but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has  
gripped the masses. Theory is capable of gripping the masses as soon as it demonstrates ad  
hominem, and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to  
grasp the root of the matter. But, for man, the root is man himself. The evident proof of the  
radicalism of German theory, and hence of its practical energy, is that is proceeds from a  
resolute positive abolition of religion. The criticism of religion ends with the teaching that man  
is the highest essence for man – hence, with the categoric imperative to overthrow all relations  
in which man is a debased, enslaved, abandoned, despicable essence, relations which cannot be  
better described than by the cry of a Frenchman when it was planned to introduce a tax on dogs:  
Poor dogs! They want to treat you as human beings!

Even historically, theoretical emancipation has specific practical significance for Germany. For  
Germany’s revolutionary past is theoretical, it is the Reformation. As the revolution then began  
in the brain of the monk, so now it begins in the brain of the philosopher.

Luther, we grant, overcame bondage out of devotion by replacing it by bondage out of  
conviction. He shattered faith in authority because he restored the authority of faith. He turned  
priests into laymen because he turned laymen into priests. He freed man from outer religiosity  
because he made religiosity the inner man. He freed the body from chains because he enchained  
the heart.

But, if Protestantism was not the true solution of the problem, it was at least the true setting of  
it. It was no longer a case of the layman’s struggle against the priest outside himself but of his  
struggle against his own priest inside himself, his priestly nature. And if the Protestant  
transformation of the German layman into priests emancipated the lay popes, the princes, with  
the whole of their priestly clique, the privileged and philistines, the philosophical transformation  
of priestly Germans into men will emancipate the people. But, secularization will not stop at the  
confiscation of church estates set in motion mainly by hypocritical Prussia any more than  
emancipation stops at princes. The Peasant War, the most radical fact of German history, came  
to grief because of theology. Today, when theology itself has come to grief, the most unfree fact  
of German history, our status quo, will be shattered against philosophy. On the eve of the  
Reformation, official Germany was the most unconditional slave of Rome. On the eve of its  
revolution, it is the unconditional slave of less than Rome, of Prussia and Austria, of country  
junkers and philistines.

Meanwhile, a major difficulty seems to stand in the way of a radical German revolution.

For revolutions require a passive element, a material basis. Theory is fulfilled in a people only  
insofar as it is the fulfilment of the needs of that people. But will the monstrous discrepancy  
between the demands of German thought and the answers of German reality find a  
corresponding discrepancy between civil society and the state, and between civil society and  
itself? Will the theoretical needs be immediate practical needs? It is not enough for thought to  
strive for realization, reality must itself strive towards thought.

But Germany did not rise to the intermediary stage of political emancipation at the same time as  
the modern nations. It has not yet reached in practice the stages which it has surpassed in theory.  
How can it do a somersault, not only over its own limitations, but at the same time over the  
limitations of the modern nations, over limitations which it must in reality feel and strive for as  
for emancipation from its real limitations? Only a revolution of radical needs can be a radical  
revolution and it seems that precisely the preconditions and ground for such needs are lacking.

If Germany has accompanied the development of the modern nations only with the abstract  
activity of thought without taking an effective share in the real struggle of that development, it  
has, on the other hand, shared the sufferings of that development, without sharing in its  
enjoyment, or its partial satisfaction. To the abstract activity on the one hand corresponds the  
abstract suffering on the other. That is why Germany will one day find itself on the level of  
European decadence before ever having been on the level of European emancipation. It will be  
comparable to a fetish worshipper pining away with the diseases of Christianity.

If we now consider the German governments, we find that because of the circumstances of the  
time, because of Germany’s condition, because of the standpoint of German education, and,  
finally, under the impulse of its own fortunate instinct, they are driven to combine the civilized  
shortcomings of the modern state world, the advantages of which we do not enjoy, with the  
barbaric deficiencies of the ancien régime, which we enjoy in full; hence, Germany must share  
more and more, if not in the reasonableness, at least in the unreasonableness of those state  
formations which are beyond the bounds of its status quo. Is there in the world, for example, a  
country which shares so naively in all the illusions of constitutional statehood without sharing in  
its realities as so-called constitutional Germany? And was it not perforce the notion of a German  
government to combine the tortures of censorship with the tortures of the French September

###### [anti-press] laws which provide for freedom of the press? As you could find the gods of all

nations in the Roman Pantheon, so you will find in the Germans’ Holy Roman Empire all the  
sins of all state forms. That this eclecticism will reach a so far unprecedented height is  
guaranteed in particular by the political-aesthetic gourmanderie of a German king who intended

Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right 35

to play all the roles of monarchy, whether feudal or democratic, if not in the person of the  
people, at least in his own person, and if not for the people, at least for himself. Germany, as the  
deficiency of the political present constituted a world of its own, will not be able to throw down  
the specific German limitations without throwing down the general limitation of the political  
present.

It is not the radical revolution, not the general human emancipation which is a utopian dream  
for Germany, but rather the partial, the merely political revolution, the revolution which leaves  
the pillars of the house standing. On what is a partial, a merely political revolution based? On  
part of civil society emancipating itself and attaining general domination; on a definite class,  
proceeding from its particular situation; undertaking the general emancipation of society. This  
class emancipates the whole of society, but only provided the whole of society is in the same  
situation as this class – e.g., possesses money and education or can acquire them at will.

No class of civil society can play this role without arousing a moment of enthusiasm in itself  
and in the masses, a moment in which it fraternizes and merges with society in general, becomes  
confused with it and is perceived and acknowledged as its general representative, a moment in  
which its claims and rights are truly the claims and rights of society itself, a moment in which it  
is truly the social head and the social heart. Only in the name of the general rights of society can  
a particular class vindicate for itself general domination. For the storming of this emancipatory  
position, and hence for the political exploitation of all sections of society in the interests of its  
own section, revolutionary energy and spiritual self-feeling alone are not sufficient. For the  
revolution of a nation, and the emancipation of a particular class of civil society to coincide, for  
one estate to be acknowledged as the estate of the whole society, all the defects of society must  
conversely be concentrated in another class, a particular estate must be the estate of the general  
stumbling-block, the incorporation of the general limitation, a particular social sphere must be  
recognized as the notorious crime of the whole of society, so that liberation from that sphere  
appears as general self-liberation. For one estate to be par excellence the estate of liberation,  
another estate must conversely be the obvious estate of oppression. The negative general  
significance of the French nobility and the French clergy determined the positive general  
significance of the nearest neighboring and opposed class of the bourgeoisie.

But no particular class in Germany has the constituency, the penetration, the courage, or the  
ruthlessness that could mark it out as the negative representative of society. No more has any  
estate the breadth of soul that identifies itself, even for a moment, with the soul of the nation, the  
geniality that inspires material might to political violence, or that revolutionary daring which  
flings at the adversary the defiant words: I am nothing but I must be everything. The main stem  
of German morals and honesty, of the classes as well as of individuals, is rather that modest  
egoism which asserts its limitedness and allows it to be asserted against itself. The relation of  
the various sections of German society is therefore not dramatic but epic. Each of them begins  
to be aware of itself and begins to camp beside the others with all its particular claims not as  
soon as it is oppressed, but as soon as the circumstances of the time, without the section’s own  
participation, creates a social substratum on which it can in turn exert pressure. Even the moral  
self-feeling of the German middle class rests only on the consciousness that it is the common  
representative of the philistine mediocrity of all the other classes. It is therefore not only the  
German kings who accede to the throne mal à propos, it is every section of civil society which  
goes through a defeat before it celebrates victory and develops its own limitations before it  
overcomes the limitations facing it, asserts its narrow-hearted essence before it has been able to  
assert its magnanimous essence; thus the very opportunity of a great role has passed away  
before it is to hand, and every class, once it begins the struggle against the class opposed to it, is  
involved in the struggle against the class below it. Hence, the higher nobility is struggling  
against the monarchy, the bureaucrat against the nobility, and the bourgeois against them all,  
while the proletariat is already beginning to find itself struggling against the bourgeoisie. The  
middle class hardly dares to grasp the thought of emancipation from its own standpoint when  
the development of the social conditions and the progress of political theory already declare that  
standpoint antiquated or at least problematic.

In France, it is enough for somebody to be something for him to want to be everything; in  
Germany, nobody can be anything if he is not prepared to renounce everything. In France,  
partial emancipation is the basis of universal emancipation; in Germany, universal emancipation

36 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

is the conditio sine qua non of any partial emancipation. In France, it is the reality of gradual  
liberation that must give birth to complete freedom, in Germany, the impossibility of gradual  
liberation. In France, every class of the nation is a political idealist and becomes aware of itself  
at first not as a particular class but as a representative of social requirements generally. The role  
of emancipator therefore passes in dramatic motion to the various classes of the French nation  
one after the other until it finally comes to the class which implements social freedom no longer  
with the provision of certain conditions lying outside man and yet created by human society, but  
rather organizes all conditions of human existence on the premises of social freedom. On the  
contrary, in Germany, where practical life is as spiritless as spiritual life is unpractical, no class  
in civil society has any need or capacity for general emancipation until it is forced by its  
immediate condition, by material necessity, by its very chains.

Where, then, is the positive possibility of a German emancipation?

Answer: In the formulation of a class with radical chains, a class of civil society which is not a  
class of civil society, an estate which is the dissolution of all estates, a sphere which has a  
universal character by its universal suffering and claims no particular right because no  
particular wrong, but wrong generally, is perpetuated against it; which can invoke no historical,  
but only human, title; which does not stand in any one-sided antithesis to the consequences but  
in all-round antithesis to the premises of German statehood; a sphere, finally, which cannot  
emancipate itself without emancipating itself from all other spheres of society and thereby  
emancipating all other spheres of society, which, in a word, is the complete loss of man and  
hence can win itself only through the complete re-winning of man. This dissolution of society as  
a particular estate is the proletariat.

The proletariat is beginning to appear in Germany as a result of the rising industrial movement.  
For, it is not the naturally arising poor but the artificially impoverished, not the human masses  
mechanically oppressed by the gravity of society, but the masses resulting from the drastic  
dissolution of society, mainly of the middle estate, that form the proletariat, although, as is  
easily understood, the naturally arising poor and the Christian-Germanic serfs gradually join its  
ranks.

By heralding the dissolution of the hereto existing world order, the proletariat merely proclaims  
the secret of its own existence, for it is the factual dissolution of that world order. By demanding  
the negation of private property, the proletariat merely raises to the rank of a principle of society  
what society has raised to the rank of its principle, what is already incorporated in it as the  
negative result of society without its own participation. The proletarian then finds himself  
possessing the same right in regard to the world which is coming into being as the German king  
in regard to the world which has come into being when he calls the people his people, as he calls  
the horse his horse. By declaring the people his private property, the king merely proclaims that  
the private owner is king.

As philosophy finds its material weapon in the proletariat, so the proletariat finds its spiritual  
weapon in philosophy. And once the lightning of thought has squarely struck this ingenuous soil  
of the people, the emancipation of the Germans into men will be accomplished.

Let us sum up the result:

The only liberation of Germany which is practically possible is liberation from the point of view  
of that theory which declares man to be the supreme being for man. Germany can emancipate  
itself from the Middle Ages only if it emancipates itself at the same time from the partial  
victories over the Middle Ages. In Germany, no form of bondage can be broken without  
breaking all forms of bondage. Germany, which is renowned for its thoroughness, cannot make  
a revolution unless it is a thorough one. The emancipation of the German is the emancipation of  
man. The head of this emancipation is philosophy, its heart the proletariat. Philosophy cannot

###### realize itself without the transcendence [Aufhebung] of the proletariat, and the proletariat cannot

transcend itself without the realization of philosophy.

When all the inner conditions are met, the day of the German resurrection will be heralded by  
the crowing of the cock of Gaul.

Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right 37

## The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte

## (1852) Chapter 1

#### I

Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak,  
twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce. Caussidière for  
Danton, Louis Blanc for Robespierre, the Montagne of 1848 to 1851 for the Montagne of 1793  
to 1795, the nephew for the uncle. And the same caricature occurs in the circumstances of the  
second edition of the Eighteenth Brumaire.

Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under  
self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted  
from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the  
living. And just as they seem to be occupied with revolutionizing themselves and things,  
creating something that did not exist before, precisely in such epochs of revolutionary crisis they  
anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle  
slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored  
disguise and borrowed language. Thus Luther put on the mask of the Apostle Paul, the  
Revolution of 1789-1814 draped itself alternately in the guise of the Roman Republic and the  
Roman Empire, and the Revolution of 1848 knew nothing better to do than to parody, now  
1789, now the revolutionary tradition of 1793-95. In like manner, the beginner who has learned  
a new language always translates it back into his mother tongue, but he assimilates the spirit of  
the new language and expresses himself freely in it only when he moves in it without recalling  
the old and when he forgets his native tongue.

When we think about this conjuring up of the dead of world history, a salient difference reveals  
itself. Camille Desmoulins, Danton, Robespierre, St. Just, Napoleon, the heroes as well as the  
parties and the masses of the old French Revolution, performed the task of their time – that of  
unchaining and establishing modern bourgeois society – in Roman costumes and with Roman  
phrases. The first one destroyed the feudal foundation and cut off the feudal heads that had  
grown on it. The other created inside France the only conditions under which free competition  
could be developed, parcelled-out land properly used, and the unfettered productive power of  
the nation employed; and beyond the French borders it swept away feudal institutions  
everywhere, to provide, as far as necessary, bourgeois society in France with an appropriate up-  
to-date environment on the European continent. Once the new social formation was established,  
the antediluvian colossi disappeared and with them also the resurrected Romanism – the  
Brutuses, the Gracchi, the publicolas, the tribunes, the senators, and Caesar himself. Bourgeois  
society in its sober reality bred its own true interpreters and spokesmen in the Says, Cousins,  
Royer-Collards, Benjamin Constants, and Guizots; its real military leaders sat behind the office  
desk and the hog-headed Louis XVIII was its political chief. Entirely absorbed in the production  
of wealth and in peaceful competitive struggle, it no longer remembered that the ghosts of the  
Roman period had watched over its cradle.

But unheroic though bourgeois society is, it nevertheless needed heroism, sacrifice, terror, civil  
war, and national wars to bring it into being. And in the austere classical traditions of the Roman  
Republic the bourgeois gladiators found the ideals and the art forms, the self-deceptions, that  
they needed to conceal from themselves the bourgeois-limited content of their struggles and to  
keep their passion on the high plane of great historic tragedy. Similarly, at another stage of  
development a century earlier, Cromwell and the English people had borrowed from the Old  
Testament the speech, emotions, and illusions for their bourgeois revolution. When the real goal  
had been achieved and the bourgeois transformation of English society had been accomplished,  
Locke supplanted Habakkuk.

Thus the awakening of the dead in those revolutions served the purpose of glorifying the new  
struggles, not of parodying the old; of magnifying the given task in the imagination, not  
recoiling from its solution in reality; of finding once more the spirit of revolution, not making its  
ghost walk again.

38 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

From 1848 to 1851, only the ghost of the old revolution circulated - from Marrast, the  
républicain en gants jaunes, who disguised himself as old Bailly, down to the adventurer who  
hides his trivial and repulsive features behind the iron death mask of Napoleon. A whole nation,  
which thought it had acquired an accelerated power of motion by means of a revolution,  
suddenly finds itself set back into a defunct epoch, and to remove any doubt about the relapse,  
the old dates arise again – the old chronology, the old names, the old edicts, which had long  
since become a subject of antiquarian scholarship, and the old minions of the law who had  
seemed long dead. The nation feels like the mad Englishman in Bedlam who thinks he is living  
in the time of the old Pharaohs and daily bewails the hard labor he must perform in the  
Ethiopian gold mines, immured in this subterranean prison, a pale lamp fastened to his head, the  
overseer of the slaves behind him with a long whip, and at the exits a confused welter of  
barbarian war slaves who understand neither the forced laborers nor each other, since they speak  
no common language. “And all this,” sighs the mad Englishman, “is expected of me, a freeborn  
Briton, in order to make gold for the Pharaohs.” “In order to pay the debts of the Bonaparte  
family,” sighs the French nation. The Englishman, so long as he was not in his right mind, could  
not get rid of his idée fixé of mining gold. The French, so long as they were engaged in  
revolution, could not get rid of the memory of Napoleon, as the election of December 10

was proved. They longed to return from the perils of revolution to the fleshpots of Egypt, and  
December 2, 1851

, was the answer. Now they have not only a caricature of the old Napoleon, but the old  
Napoleon himself, caricatured as he would have to be in the middle of the nineteenth century.

The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot take its poetry from the past but only  
from the future. It cannot begin with itself before it has stripped away all superstition about the  
past. The former revolutions required recollections of past world history in order to smother  
their own content. The revolution of the nineteenth century must let the dead bury their dead in  
order to arrive at its own content. There the phrase went beyond the content – here the content  
goes beyond the phrase.

The February Revolution was a surprise attack, a seizing of the old society unaware, and the  
people proclaimed this unexpected stroke a deed of world importance, ushering in a new epoch.  
On December 2 the February Revolution is conjured away as a cardsharp’s trick, and what  
seems overthrown is no longer the monarchy but the liberal concessions that had been wrung  
from it through centuries of struggle. Instead of society having conquered a new content for  
itself, it seems that the state has only returned to its oldest form, to a shamelessly simple rule by  
the sword and the monk’s cowl. This is the answer to the coup de main of February, 1848, given  
by the coup de téte of December, 1851. Easy come, easy go. Meantime, the interval did not pass  
unused. During 1848-51 French society, by an abbreviated revolutionary method, caught up  
with the studies and experiences which in a regular, so to speak, textbook course of  
development would have preceded the February Revolution, if the latter were to be more than a  
mere ruffling of the surface. Society seems now to have retreated to behind its starting point; in  
truth, it has first to create for itself the revolutionary point of departure – the situation, the  
relations, the conditions under which alone modern revolution becomes serious.

Bourgeois revolutions, like those of the eighteenth century, storm more swiftly from success to  
success, their dramatic effects outdo each other, men and things seem set in sparkling diamonds,  
ecstasy is the order of the day – but they are short-lived, soon they have reached their zenith,  
and a long Katzenjammer takes hold of society before it learns to assimilate the results of its  
storm-and-stress period soberly. On the other hand, proletarian revolutions, like those of the  
nineteenth century, constantly criticize themselves, constantly interrupt themselves in their own  
course, return to the apparently accomplished, in order to begin anew; they deride with cruel  
thoroughness the half-measures, weaknesses, and paltriness of their first attempts, seem to throw  
down their opponents only so the latter may draw new strength from the earth and rise before  
them again more gigantic than ever, recoil constantly from the indefinite colossalness of their  
own goals – until a situation is created which makes all turning back impossible, and the  
conditions themselves call out:

```
Hic Rhodus, hic salta!
Here is the rose, here dance!
```

Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right 39

For the rest, every fair observer, even if he had not followed the course of French developments  
step by step, must have had a presentiment of the imminence of an unheard-of disgrace for the  
revolution. It was enough to hear the complacent yelps of victory with which the democrats  
congratulated each other on the expectedly gracious consequences of the second Sunday in  
May, 1852.

In their minds that second Sunday of May had become a certain idea, a dogma, like the day of  
Christ’s reappearance and the beginning of the millennium in the minds of the Chiliasts. As  
always, weakness had taken refuge in a belief in miracles, believed the enemy to be overcome  
when he was only conjured away in imagination, and lost all understanding of the present in an  
inactive glorification of the future that was in store for it and the deeds it had in mind but did not  
want to carry out yet. Those heroes who seek to disprove their demonstrated incapacity – by  
offering each other their sympathy and getting together in a crowd – had tied up their bundles,  
collected their laurel wreaths in advance, and occupied themselves with discounting on the  
exchange market the republics in partibus for which they had already providently organized the  
government personnel with all the calm of their unassuming disposition. December 2 struck  
them like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, and those who in periods of petty depression gladly let  
their inner fears be drowned by the loudest renters will perhaps have convinced themselves that  
the times are past when the cackle of geese could save the Capitol.

The constitution, the National Assembly, the dynastic parties, the blue and red republicans, the  
heroes of Africa, the thunder from the platform, the sheet lightning of the daily press, the entire  
literature, the political names and the intellectual reputations, the civil law and the penal code,  
liberté, egalité, fraternité, and the second Sunday in May, 1852 – all have vanished like a  
phantasmagoria before the spell of a man whom even his enemies do not make out to be a  
sorcerer. Universal suffrage seems to have survived only for the moment, so that with its own  
hand it may make its last will and testament before the eyes of all the world and declare in the  
name of the people itself: “All that exists deserves to perish.”

It is not enough to say, as the French do, that their nation was taken unawares. Nations and  
women are not forgiven the unguarded hour in which the first adventurer who came along could  
violate them. Such turns of speech do not solve the riddle but only formulate it differently. It  
remains to be explained how a nation of thirty-six millions can be surprised and delivered  
without resistance into captivity by three knights of industry.

Let us recapitulate in general outline the phases that the French Revolution went through from  
February 24, 1848, to December, 1851.

Three main periods are unmistakable: the February period; the period of the constitution of the  
republic or the Constituent National Assembly - May 1848 to May 28 1849; and the period of  
the constitutional republic or the Legislative National Assembly – May 28 1849 to December 2

The first period – from February 24, the overthrow of Louis Philippe, to May 4, 1848, the  
meeting of the Constituent Assembly – the February period proper, may be designated as the  
prologue of the revolution. Its character was officially expressed in the fact that the government  
it improvised itself declared that it was provisional, and like the government, everything that  
was mentioned, attempted, or enunciated during this period proclaimed itself to be only  
provisional. Nobody and nothing ventured to lay any claim to the right of existence and of real  
action. All the elements that had prepared or determined the revolution – the dynastic  
opposition, the republican bourgeoisie, the democratic-republican petty bourgeoisie, and the  
social-democratic workers, provisionally found their place in the February government.

It could not be otherwise. The February days originally intended an electoral reform by which  
the circle of the politically privileged among the possessing class itself was to be widened and  
the exclusive domination of the aristocracy of finance overthrown. When it came to the actual  
conflict, however – when the people mounted the barricades, the National Guard maintained a  
passive attitude, the army offered no serious resistance, and the monarchy ran away – the  
republic appeared to be a matter of course. Every party construed it in its own way. Having  
secured it arms in hand, the proletariat impressed its stamp upon it and proclaimed it to be a  
social republic. There was thus indicated the general content of the modern revolution, a content  
which was in most singular contradiction to everything that, with the material available, with the

40 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

degree of education attained by the masses, under the given circumstances and relations, could  
be immediately realized in practice. On the other hand, the claims of all the remaining elements  
that had collaborated in the February Revolution were recognized by the lion’s share they  
obtained in the government. In no period, therefore, do we find a more confused mixture of  
high-flown phrases and actual uncertainty and clumsiness, of more enthusiastic striving for  
innovation and more deeply rooted domination of the old routine, of more apparent harmony of  
the whole of society; and more profound estrangement of its elements. While the Paris  
proletariat still revelled in the vision of the wide prospects that had opened before it and  
indulged in seriously meant discussions of social problems, the old powers of society had  
grouped themselves, assembled, reflected, and found unexpected support in the mass of the  
nation, the peasants and petty bourgeois, who all at once stormed onto the political stage after  
the barriers of the July Monarchy had fallen.

The second period, from May 4, 1848, to the end of May, 1849, is the period of the constitution,  
the foundation, of the bourgeois republic. Immediately after the February days not only had the  
dynastic opposition been surprised by the republicans and the republicans by the socialists, but  
all France by Paris. The National Assembly, which met on May 4, 1848, had emerged from the  
national elections and represented the nation. It was a living protest against the pretensions of  
the February days and was to reduce the results of the revolution to the bourgeois scale. In vain  
the Paris proletariat, which immediately grasped the character of this National Assembly,  
attempted on May 15, a few days after it met, to negate its existence forcibly, to dissolve it, to  
disintegrate again into its constituent parts the organic form in which the proletariat was  
threatened by the reacting spirit of the nation. As is known, May 15 had no other result but that  
of removing Blanqui and his comrades – that is, the real leaders of the proletarian party – from  
the public stage for the entire duration of the cycle we are considering.

The bourgeois monarchy of Louis Philippe can be followed only by a bourgeois republic; that is  
to say, whereas a limited section of the bourgeoisie ruled in the name of the king, the whole of  
the bourgeoisie will now rule in the name of the people. The demands of the Paris proletariat are  
utopian nonsense, to which an end must be put. To this declaration of the Constituent National  
Assembly the Paris proletariat replied with the June insurrection, the most colossal event in the  
history of European civil wars. The bourgeois republic triumphed. On its side stood the  
aristocracy of finance, the industrial bourgeoisie, the bourgeois, the petty bourgeois, the army,  
the lumpen proletariat organized as the Mobile Guard, the intellectual lights, the clergy, and the  
rural population. On the side of the Paris proletariat stood none but itself. More than three  
thousand insurgents were butchered after the victory, and fifteen thousand were deported  
without trial. With this defeat the proletariat passes into the background on the revolutionary  
stage. It attempts to press forward again on every occasion, as soon as the movement appears to  
make a fresh start, but with ever decreased expenditure of strength and always slighter results.  
As soon as one of the social strata above it gets into revolutionary ferment, the proletariat enters  
into an alliance with it and so shares all the defeats that the different parties suffer, one after  
another. But these subsequent blows become the weaker, the greater the surface of society over  
which they are distributed. The more important leaders of the proletariat in the Assembly and in  
the press successively fall victim to the courts, and ever more equivocal figures come to head it.  
In part it throws itself into doctrinaire experiments, exchange banks and workers’ associations,  
hence into a movement in which it renounces the revolutionizing of the old world by means of  
the latter’s own great, combined resources, and seeks, rather, to achieve its salvation behind  
society’s back, in private fashion, within its limited conditions of existence, and hence  
necessarily suffers shipwreck. It seems to be unable either to rediscover revolutionary greatness  
in itself or to win new energy from the connections newly entered into, until all classes with  
which it contended in June themselves lie prostrate beside it. But at least it succumbs with the  
honours of the great, world-historic struggle; not only France, but all Europe trembles at the  
June earthquake, while the ensuing defeats of the upper classes are so cheaply bought that they  
require barefaced exaggeration by the victorious party to be able to pass for events at all, and  
become the more ignominious the further the defeated party is removed from the proletarian  
party.

The defeat of the June insurgents, to be sure, had now prepared, had levelled the ground on  
which the bourgeois republic could be founded and built, but it had shown at the same time that

Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right 41

in Europe the questions at issue are other than that of “republic or monarchy.” It had revealed  
that here “bourgeois republic” signifies the unlimited despotism of one class over other classes.  
It had proved that in countries with an old civilization, with a developed formation of classes,  
with modern conditions of production, and with an intellectual consciousness in which all  
traditional ideas have been dissolved by the work of centuries, the republic signifies in general  
only the political form of revolution of bourgeois society and not its conservative form of life –  
as, for example, in the United States of North America, where, though classes already exist, they  
have not yet become fixed, but continually change and interchange their elements in constant  
flux, where the modern means of production, instead of coinciding with a stagnant surplus  
population, rather compensate for the relative deficiency of heads and hands, and where, finally,  
the feverish, youthful movement of material production, which has to make a new world of its  
own, has neither time nor opportunity left for abolishing the old world of ghosts.

During the June days all classes and parties had united in the party of Order against the  
proletarian class as the party of anarchy, of socialism, of communism. They had “saved” society  
from “the enemies of society.” They had given out the watchwords of the old society, “property,  
family, religion, order,” to their army as passwords and had proclaimed to the  
counterrevolutionary crusaders: “In this sign thou shalt conquer!” From that moment, as soon as  
one of the numerous parties which gathered under this sign against the June insurgents seeks to  
hold the revolutionary battlefield in its own class interest, it goes down before the cry:  
“property, family, religion, order.” Society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers  
contracts, as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one. Every demand of the  
simplest bourgeois financial reform, of the most ordinary liberalism, of the most formal  
republicanism, of the most shallow democracy, is simultaneously castigated as an “attempt on  
society” and stigmatized as “socialism.” And finally the high priests of “religion and order”  
themselves are driven with kicks from their Pythian tripods, hauled out of their beds in the  
darkness of night, put in prison vans, thrown into dungeons or sent into exile; their temple is  
razed to the ground, their mouths are sealed, their pens broken, their law torn to pieces in the  
name of religion, of property, of the family, of order. Bourgeois fanatics for order are shot down  
on their balconies by mobs of drunken soldiers, their domestic sanctuaries profaned, their  
houses bombarded for amusement – in the name of property, of the family, of religion, and of  
order. Finally, the scum of bourgeois society forms the holy phalanx of order and the hero  
Crapulinski installs himself in the Tuileries as the “savior of society.”

##### From the Preface

Every beginning is difficult, holds in all sciences. To understand the first chapter, especially the  
section that contains the analysis of commodities, will, therefore, present the greatest difficulty.  
That which concerns more especially the analysis of the substance of value and the magnitude  
of value, I have, as much as it was possible, popularised. The value-form, whose fully  
developed shape is the money-form, is very elementary and simple. Nevertheless, the human  
mind has for more than 2,000 years sought in vain to get to the bottom of it all, whilst on the  
other hand, to the successful analysis of much more composite and complex forms, there has  
been at least an approximation. Why? Because the body, as an organic whole, is more easy of  
study than are the cells of that body. In the analysis of economic forms, moreover, neither  
microscopes nor chemical reagents are of use. The force of abstraction must replace both. But in  
bourgeois society, the commodity-form of the product of labour – or value-form of the  
commodity – is the economic cell-form. To the superficial observer, the analysis of these forms  
seems to turn upon minutiae. It does in fact deal with minutiae, but they are of the same order as  
those dealt with in microscopic anatomy.

###### §1 The Two Factors of a Commodity: Use-Value and Value

The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself  
as “an immense accumulation of commodities,” its unit being a single commodity. Our  
investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity.

A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies  
human wants of some sort or another. The nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they  
spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference. Neither are we here concerned to  
know how the object satisfies these wants, whether directly as means of subsistence, or  
indirectly as means of production.

Every useful thing, as iron, paper, &c., may be looked at from the two points of view of quality  
and quantity. It is an assemblage of many properties, and may therefore be of use in various  
ways. To discover the various uses of things is the work of history. So also is the establishment  
of socially-recognized standards of measure for the quantities of these useful objects. The  
diversity of these measures has its origin partly in the diverse nature of the objects to be  
measured, partly in convention.

The utility of a thing makes it a use value. But this utility is not a thing of air. Being limited by  
the physical properties of the commodity, it has no existence apart from that commodity. A  
commodity, such as iron, corn, or a diamond, is therefore, so far as it is a material thing, a use  
value, something useful. This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour  
required to appropriate its useful qualities. When treating of use value, we always assume to be  
dealing with definite quantities, such as dozens of watches, yards of linen, or tons of iron. The  
use values of commodities furnish the material for a special study, that of the commercial  
knowledge of commodities. Use values become a reality only by use or consumption: they also  
constitute the substance of all wealth, whatever may be the social form of that wealth. In the  
form of society we are about to consider, they are, in addition, the material depositories of  
exchange value.

Exchange value, at first sight, presents itself as a quantitative relation, as the proportion in  
which values in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort, a relation constantly  
changing with time and place. Hence exchange value appears to be something accidental and  
purely relative, and consequently an intrinsic value, i.e., an exchange value that is inseparably  
connected with, inherent in commodities, seems a contradiction in terms. Let us consider the  
matter a little more closely.

A given commodity, e.g., a quarter of wheat is exchanged for x blacking, y silk, or z gold, &c. –  
in short, for other commodities in the most different proportions. Instead of one exchange value,  
the wheat has, therefore, a great many. But since x blacking, y silk, or z gold &c., each

Capital Volume I. The Commodity 43

represents the exchange value of one quarter of wheat, x blacking, y silk, z gold, &c., must, as  
exchange values, be replaceable by each other, or equal to each other. Therefore, first: the valid  
exchange values of a given commodity express something equal; secondly, exchange value,  
generally, is only the mode of expression, the phenomenal form, of something contained in it,  
yet distinguishable from it.

Let us take two commodities, e.g., corn and iron. The proportions in which they are  
exchangeable, whatever those proportions may be, can always be represented by an equation in  
which a given quantity of corn is equated to some quantity of iron: e.g., 1 quarter corn = x cwt.  
iron. What does this equation tell us? It tells us that in two different things – in 1 quarter of corn  
and x cwt. of iron, there exists in equal quantities something common to both. The two things  
must therefore be equal to a third, which in itself is neither the one nor the other. Each of them,  
so far as it is exchange value, must therefore be reducible to this third.

A simple geometrical illustration will make this clear. In order to calculate and compare the  
areas of rectilinear figures, we decompose them into triangles. But the area of the triangle itself  
is expressed by something totally different from its visible figure, namely, by half the product of  
the base multiplied by the altitude. In the same way the exchange values of commodities must  
be capable of being expressed in terms of something common to them all, of which thing they  
represent a greater or less quantity.

This common “something” cannot be either a geometrical, a chemical, or any other natural  
property of commodities. Such properties claim our attention only in so far as they affect the  
utility of those commodities, make them use values. But the exchange of commodities is  
evidently an act characterised by a total abstraction from use value. Then one use value is just as  
good as another, provided only it be present in sufficient quantity. Or, as old Barbon says, “one  
sort of wares are as good as another, if the values be equal. There is no difference or distinction  
in things of equal value ... An hundred pounds’ worth of lead or iron, is of as great value as one  
hundred pounds’ worth of silver or gold.”

As use values, commodities are, above all, of different qualities, but as exchange values they are  
merely different quantities, and consequently do not contain an atom of use value.

If then we leave out of consideration the use value of commodities, they have only one common  
property left, that of being products of labour. But even the product of labour itself has  
undergone a change in our hands. If we make abstraction from its use value, we make  
abstraction at the same time from the material elements and shapes that make the product a use  
value; we see in it no longer a table, a house, yarn, or any other useful thing. Its existence as a  
material thing is put out of sight. Neither can it any longer be regarded as the product of the  
labour of the joiner, the mason, the spinner, or of any other definite kind of productive labour.  
Along with the useful qualities of the products themselves, we put out of sight both the useful  
character of the various kinds of labour embodied in them, and the concrete forms of that  
labour; there is nothing left but what is common to them all; all are reduced to one and the same  
sort of labour, human labour in the abstract.

Let us now consider the residue of each of these products; it consists of the same unsubstantial  
reality in each, a mere congelation of homogeneous human labour, of labour power expended  
without regard to the mode of its expenditure. All that these things now tell us is, that human  
labour power has been expended in their production, that human labour is embodied in them.  
When looked at as crystals of this social substance, common to them all, they are – Values.

We have seen that when commodities are exchanged, their exchange value manifests itself as  
something totally independent of their use value. But if we abstract from their use value, there  
remains their Value as defined above. Therefore, the common substance that manifests itself in  
the exchange value of commodities, whenever they are exchanged, is their value. The progress  
of our investigation will show that exchange value is the only form in which the value of  
commodities can manifest itself or be expressed. For the present, however, we have to consider  
the nature of value independently of this, its form.

A use value, or useful article, therefore, has value only because human labour in the abstract has  
been embodied or materialised in it. How, then, is the magnitude of this value to be measured?  
Plainly, by the quantity of the value-creating substance, the labour, contained in the article. The

44 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

quantity of labour, however, is measured by its duration, and labour time in its turn finds its  
standard in weeks, days, and hours.

Some people might think that if the value of a commodity is determined by the quantity of  
labour spent on it, the more idle and unskilful the labourer, the more valuable would his  
commodity be, because more time would be required in its production. The labour, however,  
that forms the substance of value, is homogeneous human labour, expenditure of one uniform  
labour power. The total labour power of society, which is embodied in the sum total of the  
values of all commodities produced by that society, counts here as one homogeneous mass of  
human labour power, composed though it be of innumerable individual units. Each of these  
units is the same as any other, so far as it has the character of the average labour power of  
society, and takes effect as such; that is, so far as it requires for producing a commodity, no  
more time than is needed on an average, no more than is socially necessary. The labour time  
socially necessary is that required to produce an article under the normal conditions of  
production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time. The  
introduction of power-looms into England probably reduced by one-half the labour required to  
weave a given quantity of yarn into cloth. The hand-loom weavers, as a matter of fact, continued  
to require the same time as before; but for all that, the product of one hour of their labour  
represented after the change only half an hour’s social labour, and consequently fell to one-half  
its former value.

We see then that that which determines the magnitude of the value of any article is the amount  
of labour socially necessary, or the labour time socially necessary for its production. Each  
individual commodity, in this connexion, is to be considered as an average sample of its class.  
Commodities, therefore, in which equal quantities of labour are embodied, or which can be  
produced in the same time, have the same value. The value of one commodity is to the value of  
any other, as the labour time necessary for the production of the one is to that necessary for the  
production of the other. “As values, all commodities are only definite masses of congealed  
labour time.”

The value of a commodity would therefore remain constant, if the labour time required for its  
production also remained constant. But the latter changes with every variation in the  
productiveness of labour. This productiveness is determined by various circumstances, amongst  
others, by the average amount of skill of the workmen, the state of science, and the degree of its  
practical application, the social organisation of production, the extent and capabilities of the  
means of production, and by physical conditions. For example, the same amount of labour in  
favourable seasons is embodied in 8 bushels of corn, and in unfavourable, only in four. The  
same labour extracts from rich mines more metal than from poor mines. Diamonds are of very  
rare occurrence on the earth’s surface, and hence their discovery costs, on an average, a great  
deal of labour time. Consequently much labour is represented in a small compass. Jacob doubts  
whether gold has ever been paid for at its full value. This applies still more to diamonds.  
According to Eschwege, the total produce of the Brazilian diamond mines for the eighty years,  
ending in 1823, had not realised the price of one-and-a-half years’ average produce of the sugar  
and coffee plantations of the same country, although the diamonds cost much more labour, and  
therefore represented more value. With richer mines, the same quantity of labour would embody  
itself in more diamonds, and their value would fall. If we could succeed at a small expenditure  
of labour, in converting carbon into diamonds, their value might fall below that of bricks. In  
general, the greater the productiveness of labour, the less is the labour time required for the  
production of an article, the less is the amount of labour crystallised in that article, and the less  
is its value; and vice versâ, the less the productiveness of labour, the greater is the labour time  
required for the production of an article, and the greater is its value. The value of a commodity,  
therefore, varies directly as the quantity, and inversely as the productiveness, of the labour  
incorporated in it.

A thing can be a use value, without having value. This is the case whenever its utility to man is  
not due to labour. Such are air, virgin soil, natural meadows, &c. A thing can be useful, and the  
product of human labour, without being a commodity. Whoever directly satisfies his wants with  
the produce of his own labour, creates, indeed, use values, but not commodities. In order to  
produce the latter, he must not only produce use values, but use values for others, social use  
values. (And not only for others, without more. The mediaeval peasant produced quit-rent-corn

Capital Volume I. The Commodity 45

for his feudal lord and tithe-corn for his parson. But neither the quit-rent-corn nor the tithe-corn  
became commodities by reason of the fact that they had been produced for others. To become a  
commodity a product must be transferred to another, whom it will serve as a use value, by  
means of an exchange.) Lastly nothing can have value, without being an object of utility. If the  
thing is useless, so is the labour contained in it; the labour does not count as labour, and  
therefore creates no value.

###### §2 Two-Fold Character of Labour Embodied in Commodities

At first sight a commodity presented itself to us as a complex of two things – use value and  
exchange value. Later on, we saw also that labour, too, possesses the same twofold nature; for,  
so far as it finds expression in value, it does not possess the same characteristics that belong to it  
as a creator of use values. I was the first to point out and to examine critically this twofold  
nature of the labour contained in commodities. As this point is the pivot on which a clear  
comprehension of political economy turns, we must go more into detail.

Let us take two commodities such as a coat and 10 yards of linen, and let the former be double  
the value of the latter, so that, if 10 yards of linen = W, the coat = 2W.

The coat is a use value that satisfies a particular want. Its existence is the result of a special sort  
of productive activity, the nature of which is determined by its aim, mode of operation, subject,  
means, and result. The labour, whose utility is thus represented by the value in use of its  
product, or which manifests itself by making its product a use value, we call useful labour. In  
this connection we consider only its useful effect.

As the coat and the linen are two qualitatively different use values, so also are the two forms of  
labour that produce them, tailoring and weaving. Were these two objects not qualitatively  
different, not produced respectively by labour of different quality, they could not stand to each  
other in the relation of commodities. Coats are not exchanged for coats, one use value is not  
exchanged for another of the same kind.

To all the different varieties of values in use there correspond as many different kinds of useful  
labour, classified according to the order, genus, species, and variety to which they belong in the  
social division of labour. This division of labour is a necessary condition for the production of  
commodities, but it does not follow, conversely, that the production of commodities is a  
necessary condition for the division of labour. In the primitive Indian community there is social  
division of labour, without production of commodities. Or, to take an example nearer home, in  
every factory the labour is divided according to a system, but this division is not brought about  
by the operatives mutually exchanging their individual products. Only such products can  
become commodities with regard to each other, as result from different kinds of labour, each  
kind being carried on independently and for the account of private individuals.

To resume, then: In the use value of each commodity there is contained useful labour, i.e.,  
productive activity of a definite kind and exercised with a definite aim. Use values cannot  
confront each other as commodities, unless the useful labour embodied in them is qualitatively  
different in each of them. In a community, the produce of which in general takes the form of  
commodities, i.e., in a community of commodity producers, this qualitative difference between  
the useful forms of labour that are carried on independently by individual producers, each on  
their own account, develops into a complex system, a social division of labour.

Anyhow, whether the coat be worn by the tailor or by his customer, in either case it operates as  
a use value. Nor is the relation between the coat and the labour that produced it altered by the  
circumstance that tailoring may have become a special trade, an independent branch of the  
social division of labour. Wherever the want of clothing forced them to it, the human race made  
clothes for thousands of years, without a single man becoming a tailor. But coats and linen, like  
every other element of material wealth that is not the spontaneous produce of Nature, must  
invariably owe their existence to a special productive activity, exercised with a definite aim, an  
activity that appropriates particular nature-given materials to particular human wants. So far  
therefore as labour is a creator of use value, is useful labour, it is a necessary condition,  
independent of all forms of society, for the existence of the human race; it is an eternal nature-  
imposed necessity, without which there can be no material exchanges between man and Nature,  
and therefore no life.

46 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

The use values, coat, linen, &c., i.e., the bodies of commodities, are combinations of two  
elements – matter and labour. If we take away the useful labour expended upon them, a material  
substratum is always left, which is furnished by Nature without the help of man. The latter can  
work only as Nature does, that is by changing the form of matter. Nay more, in this work of  
changing the form he is constantly helped by natural forces. We see, then, that labour is not the  
only source of material wealth, of use values produced by labour. As William Petty puts it,  
labour is its father and the earth its mother.

Let us now pass from the commodity considered as a use value to the value of commodities.

By our assumption, the coat is worth twice as much as the linen. But this is a mere quantitative  
difference, which for the present does not concern us. We bear in mind, however, that if the  
value of the coat is double that of 10 yds of linen, 20 yds of linen must have the same value as  
one coat. So far as they are values, the coat and the linen are things of a like substance, objective  
expressions of essentially identical labour. But tailoring and weaving are, qualitatively, different  
kinds of labour. There are, however, states of society in which one and the same man does  
tailoring and weaving alternately, in which case these two forms of labour are mere  
modifications of the labour of the same individual, and not special and fixed functions of  
different persons, just as the coat which our tailor makes one day, and the trousers which he  
makes another day, imply only a variation in the labour of one and the same individual.  
Moreover, we see at a glance that, in our capitalist society, a given portion of human labour is,  
in accordance with the varying demand, at one time supplied in the form of tailoring, at another  
in the form of weaving. This change may possibly not take place without friction, but take place  
it must.

Productive activity, if we leave out of sight its special form, viz., the useful character of the  
labour, is nothing but the expenditure of human labour power. Tailoring and weaving, though  
qualitatively different productive activities, are each a productive expenditure of human brains,  
nerves, and muscles, and in this sense are human labour. They are but two different modes of  
expending human labour power. Of course, this labour power, which remains the same under all  
its modifications, must have attained a certain pitch of development before it can be expended in  
a multiplicity of modes. But the value of a commodity represents human labour in the abstract,  
the expenditure of human labour in general. And just as in society, a general or a banker plays a  
great part, but mere man, on the other hand, a very shabby part, so here with mere human  
labour. It is the expenditure of simple labour power, i.e., of the labour power which, on an  
average, apart from any special development, exists in the organism of every ordinary  
individual. Simple average labour, it is true, varies in character in different countries and at  
different times, but in a particular society it is given. Skilled labour counts only as simple labour  
intensified, or rather, as multiplied simple labour, a given quantity of skilled being considered  
equal to a greater quantity of simple labour. Experience shows that this reduction is constantly  
being made. A commodity may be the product of the most skilled labour, but its value, by  
equating it to the product of simple unskilled labour, represents a definite quantity of the latter  
labour alone. The different proportions in which different sorts of labour are reduced to  
unskilled labour as their standard, are established by a social process that goes on behind the  
backs of the producers, and, consequently, appear to be fixed by custom. For simplicity’s sake  
we shall henceforth account every kind of labour to be unskilled, simple labour; by this we do  
no more than save ourselves the trouble of making the reduction.

Just as, therefore, in viewing the coat and linen as values, we abstract from their different use  
values, so it is with the labour represented by those values: we disregard the difference between  
its useful forms, weaving and tailoring. As the use values, coat and linen, are combinations of  
special productive activities with cloth and yarn, while the values, coat and linen, are, on the  
other hand, mere homogeneous congelations of undifferentiated labour, so the labour embodied  
in these latter values does not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and yarn, but  
only as being expenditure of human labour power. Tailoring and weaving are necessary factors  
in the creation of the use values, coat and linen, precisely because these two kinds of labour are  
of different qualities; but only in so far as abstraction is made from their special qualities, only  
in so far as both possess the same quality of being human labour, do tailoring and weaving form  
the substance of the values of the same articles.

Capital Volume I. The Commodity 47

Coats and linen, however, are not merely values, but values of definite magnitude, and  
according to our assumption, the coat is worth twice as much as the ten yards of linen. Whence  
this difference in their values? It is owing to the fact that the linen contains only half as much  
labour as the coat, and consequently, that in the production of the latter, labour power must have  
been expended during twice the time necessary for the production of the former.

While, therefore, with reference to use value, the labour contained in a commodity counts only  
qualitatively, with reference to value it counts only quantitatively, and must first be reduced to  
human labour pure and simple. In the former case, it is a question of How and What, in the latter  
of How much? How long a time? Since the magnitude of the value of a commodity represents  
only the quantity of labour embodied in it, it follows that all commodities, when taken in certain  
proportions, must be equal in value.

If the productive power of all the different sorts of useful labour required for the production of a  
coat remains unchanged, the sum of the values of the coats produced increases with their  
number. If one coat represents x days’ labour, two coats represent 2x days’ labour, and so on.  
But assume that the duration of the labour necessary for the production of a coat becomes  
doubled or halved. In the first case one coat is worth as much as two coats were before; in the  
second case, two coats are only worth as much as one was before, although in both cases one  
coat renders the same service as before, and the useful labour embodied in it remains of the  
same quality. But the quantity of labour spent on its production has altered.

An increase in the quantity of use values is an increase of material wealth. With two coats two  
men can be clothed, with one coat only one man. Nevertheless, an increased quantity of material  
wealth may correspond to a simultaneous fall in the magnitude of its value. This antagonistic  
movement has its origin in the twofold character of labour. Productive power has reference, of  
course, only to labour of some useful concrete form, the efficacy of any special productive  
activity during a given time being dependent on its productiveness. Useful labour becomes,  
therefore, a more or less abundant source of products, in proportion to the rise or fall of its  
productiveness. On the other hand, no change in this productiveness affects the labour  
represented by value. Since productive power is an attribute of the concrete useful forms of  
labour, of course it can no longer have any bearing on that labour, so soon as we make  
abstraction from those concrete useful forms. However then productive power may vary, the  
same labour, exercised during equal periods of time, always yields equal amounts of value. But  
it will yield, during equal periods of time, different quantities of values in use; more, if the  
productive power rise, fewer, if it fall. The same change in productive power, which increases  
the fruitfulness of labour, and, in consequence, the quantity of use values produced by that  
labour, will diminish the total value of this increased quantity of use values, provided such  
change shorten the total labour time necessary for their production; and vice versâ.

On the one hand all labour is, speaking physiologically, an expenditure of human labour power,  
and in its character of identical abstract human labour, it creates and forms the value of  
commodities. On the other hand, all labour is the expenditure of human labour power in a  
special form and with a definite aim, and in this, its character of concrete useful labour, it  
produces use values.

###### §3 The Form of Value

Commodities come into the world in the shape of use values, articles, or goods, such as iron,  
linen, corn, &c. This is their plain, homely, bodily form. They are, however, commodities, only  
because they are something twofold, both objects of utility, and, at the same time, depositories  
of value. They manifest themselves therefore as commodities, or have the form of commodities,  
only in so far as they have two forms, a physical or natural form, and a value form.

The reality of the value of commodities differs in this respect from Dame Quickly, that we don’t  
know “where to have it.” The value of commodities is the very opposite of the coarse  
materiality of their substance, not an atom of matter enters into its composition. Turn and  
examine a single commodity, by itself, as we will, yet in so far as it remains an object of value,  
it seems impossible to grasp it. If, however, we bear in mind that the value of commodities has a  
purely social reality, and that they acquire this reality only in so far as they are expressions or  
embodiments of one identical social substance, viz., human labour, it follows as a matter of  
course, that value can only manifest itself in the social relation of commodity to commodity. In

fact we started from exchange value, or the exchange relation of commodities, in order to get at  
the value that lies hidden behind it. We must now return to this form under which value first  
appeared to us.

Every one knows, if he knows nothing else, that commodities have a value form common to  
them all, and presenting a marked contrast with the varied bodily forms of their use values. I  
mean their money form. Here, however, a task is set us, the performance of which has never yet  
even been attempted by bourgeois economy, the task of tracing the genesis of this money form,  
of developing the expression of value implied in the value relation of commodities, from its  
simplest, almost imperceptible outline, to the dazzling money-form. By doing this we shall, at  
the same time, solve the riddle presented by money.

The simplest value-relation is evidently that of one commodity to some one other commodity of  
a different kind. Hence the relation between the values of two commodities supplies us with the  
simplest expression of the value of a single commodity.

###### §4 The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret thereof

A commodity appears, at first sight, a very trivial thing, and easily understood. Its analysis  
shows that it is, in reality, a very queer thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and  
theological niceties. So far as it is a value in use, there is nothing mysterious about it, whether  
we consider it from the point of view that by its properties it is capable of satisfying human  
wants, or from the point that those properties are the product of human labour. It is as clear as  
noon-day, that man, by his industry, changes the forms of the materials furnished by Nature, in  
such a way as to make them useful to him. The form of wood, for instance, is altered, by making  
a table out of it. Yet, for all that, the table continues to be that common, every-day thing, wood.  
But, so soon as it steps forth as a commodity, it is changed into something transcendent. It not  
only stands with its feet on the ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its  
head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than “table-  
turning” ever was.

The mystical character of commodities does not originate, therefore, in their use value. Just as  
little does it proceed from the nature of the determining factors of value. For, in the first place,  
however varied the useful kinds of labour, or productive activities, may be, it is a physiological  
fact, that they are functions of the human organism, and that each such function, whatever may  
be its nature or form, is essentially the expenditure of human brain, nerves, muscles, &c.  
Secondly, with regard to that which forms the ground-work for the quantitative determination of  
value, namely, the duration of that expenditure, or the quantity of labour, it is quite clear that  
there is a palpable difference between its quantity and quality. In all states of society, the labour  
time that it costs to produce the means of subsistence, must necessarily be an object of interest  
to mankind, though not of equal interest in different stages of development. And lastly, from  
the moment that men in any way work for one another, their labour assumes a social form.

Capital Volume I. The Commodity 49

Whence, then, arises the enigmatical character of the product of labour, so soon as it assumes  
the form of commodities? Clearly from this form itself. The equality of all sorts of human  
labour is expressed objectively by their products all being equally values; the measure of the  
expenditure of labour power by the duration of that expenditure, takes the form of the quantity  
of value of the products of labour; and finally the mutual relations of the producers, within  
which the social character of their labour affirms itself, take the form of a social relation  
between the products.

A commodity is therefore a mysterious thing, simply because in it the social character of men’s  
labour appears to them as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour;  
because the relation of the producers to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as  
a social relation, existing not between themselves, but between the products of their labour. This  
is the reason why the products of labour become commodities, social things whose qualities are  
at the same time perceptible and imperceptible by the senses. In the same way the light from an  
object is perceived by us not as the subjective excitation of our optic nerve, but as the objective  
form of something outside the eye itself. But, in the act of seeing, there is at all events, an actual  
passage of light from one thing to another, from the external object to the eye. There is a  
physical relation between physical things. But it is different with commodities. There, the  
existence of the things quâ commodities, and the value relation between the products of labour  
which stamps them as commodities, have absolutely no connection with their physical  
properties and with the material relations arising therefrom. There it is a definite social relation  
between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things. In  
order, therefore, to find an analogy, we must have recourse to the mist-enveloped regions of the  
religious world. In that world the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings  
endowed with life, and entering into relation both with one another and the human race. So it is  
in the world of commodities with the products of men’s hands. This I call the Fetishism which  
attaches itself to the products of labour, so soon as they are produced as commodities, and  
which is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities.

This Fetishism of commodities has its origin, as the foregoing analysis has already shown, in the  
peculiar social character of the labour that produces them.

As a general rule, articles of utility become commodities, only because they are products of the  
labour of private individuals or groups of individuals who carry on their work independently of  
each other. The sum total of the labour of all these private individuals forms the aggregate  
labour of society. Since the producers do not come into social contact with each other until they  
exchange their products, the specific social character of each producer’s labour does not show  
itself except in the act of exchange. In other words, the labour of the individual asserts itself as a  
part of the labour of society, only by means of the relations which the act of exchange  
establishes directly between the products, and indirectly, through them, between the producers.  
To the latter, therefore, the relations connecting the labour of one individual with that of the rest  
appear, not as direct social relations between individuals at work, but as what they really are,  
material relations between persons and social relations between things. It is only by being  
exchanged that the products of labour acquire, as values, one uniform social status, distinct from  
their varied forms of existence as objects of utility. This division of a product into a useful thing  
and a value becomes practically important, only when exchange has acquired such an extension  
that useful articles are produced for the purpose of being exchanged, and their character as  
values has therefore to be taken into account, beforehand, during production. From this moment  
the labour of the individual producer acquires socially a twofold character. On the one hand, it  
must, as a definite useful kind of labour, satisfy a definite social want, and thus hold its place as  
part and parcel of the collective labour of all, as a branch of a social division of labour that has  
sprung up spontaneously. On the other hand, it can satisfy the manifold wants of the individual  
producer himself, only in so far as the mutual exchangeability of all kinds of useful private  
labour is an established social fact, and therefore the private useful labour of each producer  
ranks on an equality with that of all others. The equalisation of the most different kinds of  
labour can be the result only of an abstraction from their inequalities, or of reducing them to  
their common denominator, viz. expenditure of human labour power or human labour in the  
abstract. The twofold social character of the labour of the individual appears to him, when  
reflected in his brain, only under those forms which are impressed upon that labour in every-day

50 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

practice by the exchange of products. In this way, the character that his own labour possesses of  
being socially useful takes the form of the condition, that the product must be not only useful,  
but useful for others, and the social character that his particular labour has of being the equal of  
all other particular kinds of labour, takes the form that all the physically different articles that  
are the products of labour. have one common quality, viz., that of having value.

Hence, when we bring the products of our labour into relation with each other as values, it is not  
because we see in these articles the material receptacles of homogeneous human labour. Quite  
the contrary: whenever, by an exchange, we equate as values our different products, by that very  
act, we also equate, as human labour, the different kinds of labour expended upon them. We are  
not aware of this, nevertheless we do it. Value, therefore, does not stalk about with a label  
describing what it is. It is value, rather, that converts every product into a social hieroglyphic.  
Later on, we try to decipher the hieroglyphic, to get behind the secret of our own social  
products; for to stamp an object of utility as a value, is just as much a social product as  
language. The recent scientific discovery, that the products of labour, so far as they are values,  
are but material expressions of the human labour spent in their production, marks, indeed, an  
epoch in the history of the development of the human race, but, by no means, dissipates the mist  
through which the social character of labour appears to us to be an objective character of the  
products themselves. The fact, that in the particular form of production with which we are  
dealing, viz., the production of commodities, the specific social character of private labour  
carried on independently, consists in the equality of every kind of that labour, by virtue of its  
being human labour, which character, therefore, assumes in the product the form of value – this  
fact appears to the producers, notwithstanding the discovery above referred to, to be just as real  
and final, as the fact, that, after the discovery by science of the component gases of air, the  
atmosphere itself remained unaltered.

What, first of all, practically concerns producers when they make an exchange, is the question,  
how much of some other product they get for their own? in what proportions the products are  
exchangeable? When these proportions have, by custom, attained a certain stability, they appear  
to result from the nature of the products, so that, for instance, one ton of iron and two ounces of  
gold appear as naturally to be of equal value as a pound of gold and a pound of iron in spite of  
their different physical and chemical qualities appear to be of equal weight. The character of  
having value, when once impressed upon products, obtains fixity only by reason of their acting  
and re-acting upon each other as quantities of value. These quantities vary continually,  
independently of the will, foresight and action of the producers. To them, their own social action  
takes the form of the action of objects, which rule the producers instead of being ruled by them.  
It requires a fully developed production of commodities before, from accumulated experience  
alone, the scientific conviction springs up, that all the different kinds of private labour, which  
are carried on independently of each other, and yet as spontaneously developed branches of the  
social division of labour, are continually being reduced to the quantitative proportions in which  
society requires them. And why? Because, in the midst of all the accidental and ever fluctuating  
exchange relations between the products, the labour time socially necessary for their production  
forcibly asserts itself like an over-riding law of Nature. The law of gravity thus asserts itself  
when a house falls about our ears. The determination of the magnitude of value by labour time  
is therefore a secret, hidden under the apparent fluctuations in the relative values of  
commodities. Its discovery, while removing all appearance of mere accidentality from the  
determination of the magnitude of the values of products, yet in no way alters the mode in  
which that determination takes place.

Man’s reflections on the forms of social life, and consequently, also, his scientific analysis of  
those forms, take a course directly opposite to that of their actual historical development. He  
begins, post festum, with the results of the process of development ready to hand before him.  
The characters that stamp products as commodities, and whose establishment is a necessary  
preliminary to the circulation of commodities, have already acquired the stability of natural,  
self-understood forms of social life, before man seeks to decipher, not their historical character,  
for in his eyes they are immutable, but their meaning. Consequently it was the analysis of the  
prices of commodities that alone led to the determination of the magnitude of value, and it was  
the common expression of all commodities in money that alone led to the establishment of their  
characters as values. It is, however, just this ultimate money form of the world of commodities

Capital Volume I. The Commodity 51

that actually conceals, instead of disclosing, the social character of private labour, and the social  
relations between the individual producers. When I state that coats or boots stand in a relation to  
linen, because it is the universal incarnation of abstract human labour, the absurdity of the  
statement is self-evident. Nevertheless, when the producers of coats and boots compare those  
articles with linen, or, what is the same thing, with gold or silver, as the universal equivalent,  
they express the relation between their own private labour and the collective labour of society in  
the same absurd form.

The categories of bourgeois economy consist of such like forms. They are forms of thought  
expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite, historically determined  
mode of production, viz., the production of commodities. The whole mystery of commodities,  
all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labour as long as they take the  
form of commodities, vanishes therefore, so soon as we come to other forms of production.

Since Robinson Crusoe’s experiences are a favourite theme with political economists, let us  
take a look at him on his island. Moderate though he be, yet some few wants he has to satisfy,  
and must therefore do a little useful work of various sorts, such as making tools and furniture,  
taming goats, fishing and hunting. Of his prayers and the like we take no account, since they are  
a source of pleasure to him, and he looks upon them as so much recreation. In spite of the  
variety of his work, he knows that his labour, whatever its form, is but the activity of one and  
the same Robinson, and consequently, that it consists of nothing but different modes of human  
labour. Necessity itself compels him to apportion his time accurately between his different kinds  
of work. Whether one kind occupies a greater space in his general activity than another, depends  
on the difficulties, greater or less as the case may be, to be overcome in attaining the useful  
effect aimed at. This our friend Robinson soon learns by experience, and having rescued a  
watch, ledger, and pen and ink from the wreck, commences, like a true-born Briton, to keep a  
set of books. His stock-book contains a list of the objects of utility that belong to him, of the  
operations necessary for their production; and lastly, of the labour time that definite quantities of  
those objects have, on an average, cost him. All the relations between Robinson and the objects  
that form this wealth of his own creation, are here so simple and clear as to be intelligible  
without exertion, even to Mr. Sedley Taylor. And yet those relations contain all that is essential  
to the determination of value.

Let us now transport ourselves from Robinson’s island bathed in light to the European middle  
ages shrouded in darkness. Here, instead of the independent man, we find everyone dependent,  
serfs and lords, vassals and suzerains, laymen and clergy. Personal dependence here  
characterises the social relations of production just as much as it does the other spheres of life  
organised on the basis of that production. But for the very reason that personal dependence  
forms the ground-work of society, there is no necessity for labour and its products to assume a  
fantastic form different from their reality. They take the shape, in the transactions of society, of  
services in kind and payments in kind. Here the particular and natural form of labour, and not,  
as in a society based on production of commodities, its general abstract form is the immediate  
social form of labour. Compulsory labour is just as properly measured by time, as commodity-  
producing labour; but every serf knows that what he expends in the service of his lord, is a  
definite quantity of his own personal labour power. The tithe to be rendered to the priest is more  
matter of fact than his blessing. No matter, then, what we may think of the parts played by the  
different classes of people themselves in this society, the social relations between individuals in  
the performance of their labour, appear at all events as their own mutual personal relations, and  
are not disguised under the shape of social relations between the products of labour.

For an example of labour in common or directly associated labour, we have no occasion to go  
back to that spontaneously developed form which we find on the threshold of the history of all  
civilised races. We have one close at hand in the patriarchal industries of a peasant family, that  
produces corn, cattle, yarn, linen, and clothing for home use. These different articles are, as  
regards the family, so many products of its labour, but as between themselves, they are not  
commodities. The different kinds of labour, such as tillage, cattle tending, spinning, weaving  
and making clothes, which result in the various products, are in themselves, and such as they  
are, direct social functions, because functions of the family, which, just as much as a society  
based on the production of commodities, possesses a spontaneously developed system of  
division of labour. The distribution of the work within the family, and the regulation of the

52 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

labour time of the several members, depend as well upon differences of age and sex as upon  
natural conditions varying with the seasons. The labour power of each individual, by its very  
nature, operates in this case merely as a definite portion of the whole labour power of the  
family, and therefore, the measure of the expenditure of individual labour power by its duration,  
appears here by its very nature as a social character of their labour.

Let us now picture to ourselves, by way of change, a community of free individuals, carrying on  
their work with the means of production in common, in which the labour power of all the  
different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour power of the community. All  
the characteristics of Robinson’s labour are here repeated, but with this difference, that they are  
social, instead of individual. Everything produced by him was exclusively the result of his own  
personal labour, and therefore simply an object of use for himself. The total product of our  
community is a social product. One portion serves as fresh means of production and remains  
social. But another portion is consumed by the members as means of subsistence. A distribution  
of this portion amongst them is consequently necessary. The mode of this distribution will vary  
with the productive organisation of the community, and the degree of historical development  
attained by the producers. We will assume, but merely for the sake of a parallel with the  
production of commodities, that the share of each individual producer in the means of  
subsistence is determined by his labour time. Labour time would, in that case, play a double  
part. Its apportionment in accordance with a definite social plan maintains the proper proportion  
between the different kinds of work to be done and the various wants of the community. On the  
other hand, it also serves as a measure of the portion of the common labour borne by each  
individual, and of his share in the part of the total product destined for individual consumption.  
The social relations of the individual producers, with regard both to their labour and to its  
products, are in this case perfectly simple and intelligible, and that with regard not only to  
production but also to distribution.

The religious world is but the reflex of the real world. And for a society based upon the  
production of commodities, in which the producers in general enter into social relations with  
one another by treating their products as commodities and values, whereby they reduce their  
individual private labour to the standard of homogeneous human labour – for such a society,  
Christianity with its cultus of abstract man, more especially in its bourgeois developments,  
Protestantism, Deism, &c., is the most fitting form of religion. In the ancient Asiatic and other  
ancient modes of production, we find that the conversion of products into commodities, and  
therefore the conversion of men into producers of commodities, holds a subordinate place,  
which, however, increases in importance as the primitive communities approach nearer and  
nearer to their dissolution. Trading nations, properly so called, exist in the ancient world only in  
its interstices, like the gods of Epicurus in the Intermundia, or like Jews in the pores of Polish  
society. Those ancient social organisms of production are, as compared with bourgeois society,  
extremely simple and transparent. But they are founded either on the immature development of  
man individually, who has not yet severed the umbilical cord that unites him with his fellowmen  
in a primitive tribal community, or upon direct relations of subjection. They can arise and exist  
only when the development of the productive power of labour has not risen beyond a low stage,  
and when, therefore, the social relations within the sphere of material life, between man and  
man, and between man and Nature, are correspondingly narrow. This narrowness is reflected in  
the ancient worship of Nature, and in the other elements of the popular religions. The religious  
reflex of the real world can, in any case, only then finally vanish, when the practical relations of  
every-day life offer to man none but perfectly intelligible and reasonable relations with regard to  
his fellowmen and to Nature.

The life-process of society, which is based on the process of material production, does not strip  
off its mystical veil until it is treated as production by freely associated men, and is consciously  
regulated by them in accordance with a settled plan. This, however, demands for society a  
certain material ground-work or set of conditions of existence which in their turn are the  
spontaneous product of a long and painful process of development.

Political Economy has indeed analysed, however incompletely, value and its magnitude, and  
has discovered what lies beneath these forms. But it has never once asked the question why  
labour is represented by the value of its product and labour time by the magnitude of that value.  
These formulæ, which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they belong to a

Capital Volume I. The Commodity 53

state of society, in which the process of production has the mastery over man, instead of being  
controlled by him, such formulæ appear to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a self-evident  
necessity imposed by Nature as productive labour itself. Hence forms of social production that  
preceded the bourgeois form, are treated by the bourgeoisie in much the same way as the  
Fathers of the Church treated pre-Christian religions.

To what extent some economists are misled by the Fetishism inherent in commodities, or by the  
objective appearance of the social characteristics of labour, is shown, amongst other ways, by  
the dull and tedious quarrel over the part played by Nature in the formation of exchange value.  
Since exchange value is a definite social manner of expressing the amount of labour bestowed  
upon an object, Nature has no more to do with it, than it has in fixing the course of exchange.

The mode of production in which the product takes the form of a commodity, or is produced  
directly for exchange, is the most general and most embryonic form of bourgeois production. It  
therefore makes its appearance at an early date in history, though not in the same predominating  
and characteristic manner as now-a-days. Hence its Fetish character is comparatively easy to be  
seen through. But when we come to more concrete forms, even this appearance of simplicity  
vanishes. Whence arose the illusions of the monetary system? To it gold and silver, when  
serving as money, did not represent a social relation between producers, but were natural objects  
with strange social properties. And modern economy, which looks down with such disdain on  
the monetary system, does not its superstition come out as clear as noon-day, whenever it treats  
of capital? How long is it since economy discarded the physiocratic illusion, that rents grow out  
of the soil and not out of society?

But not to anticipate, we will content ourselves with yet another example relating to the  
commodity form. Could commodities themselves speak, they would say: Our use value may be  
a thing that interests men. It is no part of us as objects. What, however, does belong to us as  
objects, is our value. Our natural intercourse as commodities proves it. In the eyes of each other  
we are nothing but exchange values. Now listen how those commodities speak through the  
mouth of the economist.

“Value” – (i.e., exchange value) “is a property of things, riches” – (i.e., use value) “of man.  
Value, in this sense, necessarily implies exchanges, riches do not.” “Riches” (use value) “are  
the attribute of men, value is the attribute of commodities. A man or a community is rich, a pearl  
or a diamond is valuable...” A pearl or a diamond is valuable as a pearl or a diamond.

So far no chemist has ever discovered exchange value either in a pearl or a diamond. The  
economic discoverers of this chemical element, who by-the-bye lay special claim to critical  
acumen, find however that the use value of objects belongs to them independently of their  
material properties, while their value, on the other hand, forms a part of them as objects. What  
confirms them in this view, is the peculiar circumstance that the use value of objects is realised  
without exchange, by means of a direct relation between the objects and man, while, on the  
other hand, their value is realised only by exchange, that is, by means of a social process. Who  
fails here to call to mind our good friend, Dogberry, who informs neighbour Seacoal, that, “To  
be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune; but reading and writing comes by Nature.”

## Capital Vol. III. Chapter 2. The Rate of Profit

The general formula of capital is M-C-M’. In other words, a sum of value is thrown into  
circulation to extract a larger sum out of it. The process which produces this larger sum is  
capitalist production. The process that realises it is circulation of capital. The capitalist does not  
produce a commodity for its own sake, nor for the sake of its use-value, or his personal  
consumption. The product in which the capitalist is really interested is not the palpable product  
itself, but the excess value of the product over the value of the capital consumed by it. The  
capitalist advances the total capital without regard to the different roles played by its  
components in the production of surplus-value. He advances all these components uniformly,  
not just to reproduce the advanced capital, but rather to produce value in excess of it. The only  
way in which he can convert the value of his advanced variable capital into a greater value is by  
exchanging it for living labour and exploiting living labour. But he cannot exploit this labour  
unless he makes a simultaneous advance of the conditions for performing this labour, namely  
means of labour and subjects of labour, machinery and raw materials, i.e., unless he converts a  
certain amount of value in his possession into the form of conditions of production; for he is a  
capitalist and can undertake the process of exploiting labour only because, being the owner of  
the conditions of labour, he confronts the labourer as the owner of only labour-power. As  
already shown in the first book, it is precisely the fact that non-workers own the means of  
production which turns labourers into wage-workers and non-workers into capitalists.

The capitalist does not care whether it is considered that he advances constant capital to make a  
profit out of his variable capital, or that he advances variable capital to enhance the value of the  
constant capital; that he invests money in wages to raise the value of his machinery and raw  
materials, or that he invests money in machinery and raw materials to be able to exploit labour.  
Although it is only the variable portion of capital which creates surplus-value, it does so only if  
the other portions, the conditions of production, are likewise advanced. Seeing that the capitalist  
can exploit labour only by advancing constant capital and that he can turn his constant capital to  
good account only by advancing variable capital, he lumps them all together in his imagination,  
and much more so since the actual rate of his gain is not determined by its proportion to the  
variable, but to the total capital, not by the rate of surplus-value, but by the rate of profit. And  
the latter, as we shall see, may remain the same and yet express different rates of surplus-value.

The costs of the product include all the elements of its value paid by the capitalist or for which  
he has thrown an equivalent into production. These costs must be made good to preserve the  
capital or to reproduce it in its original magnitude.

The value contained in a commodity is equal to the labour-time expended in its production, and  
the sum of this labour consists of paid and unpaid portions. But for the capitalist the costs of the  
commodity consist only of that portion of the labour materialised in it for which he has paid.  
The surplus-labour contained in the commodity costs the capitalist nothing, although, like the  
paid portion, it costs the labourer his labour, and although it creates value and enters into the  
commodity as a value-creating element quite like paid labour. The capitalist’s profit is derived  
from the fact that he has something to sell for which he has paid nothing. The surplus-value, or  
profit, consists precisely in the excess value of a commodity over its cost-price, i.e., the excess  
of the total labour embodied in the commodity over the paid labour embodied in it. The surplus-  
value, whatever its origin, is thus a surplus over the advanced total capital. The proportion of  
this surplus to the total capital is therefore expressed by the fraction s/C, in which C stands for  
total capital. We thus obtain the rate of profit s/C=s/(c+v), as distinct from the rate of surplus-  
value s/v.

The rate of surplus-value measured against the variable capital is called rate of surplus-value.  
The rate of surplus-value measured against the total capital is called rate of profit. These are two  
different measurements of the same entity, and owing to the difference of the two standards of  
measurement they express different proportions or relations of this entity.

The transformation of surplus-value into profit must be deduced from the transformation of the  
rate of surplus-value into the rate of profit, not vice versa. And in fact it was rate of profit which  
was the historical point of departure. Surplus-value and rate of surplus-value are, relatively, the

Capital Volume III. The Rate of Profit 55

invisible and unknown essence that wants investigating, while rate of profit and therefore the  
appearance of surplus-value in the form of profit are revealed on the surface of the phenomenon.

So far as the individual capitalist is concerned, it is evident that he is only interested in the  
relation of the surplus-value, or the excess value at which he sells his commodities, to the total  
capital advanced for the production of the commodities, while the specific relationship and inner  
connection of this surplus with the various components of capital fail to interest him, and it is,  
moreover, rather in his interests to draw the veil over this specific relationship and this intrinsic  
connection.

Although the excess value of a commodity over its cost-price is shaped in the immediate process  
of production, it is realised only in the process of circulation, and appears all the more readily to  
have arisen from the process of circulation, since in reality, under competition, in the actual  
market, it depends on market conditions whether or not and to what extent this surplus is  
realised. There is no need to waste words at this point about the fact that if a commodity is sold  
above or below its value, there is merely another kind of division of surplus-value, and that this  
different division, this changed proportion in which various persons share in the surplus-value,  
does not in any way alter either the magnitude or the nature of that surplus-value. It is not alone  
the metamorphoses discussed by us in Book II that take place in the process of circulation; they  
fall in with actual competition, the sale and purchase of commodities above or below their  
value, so that the surplus-value realised by the individual capitalist depends as much on the  
sharpness of his business wits as on the direct exploitation of labour.

In the process of circulation the time of circulation comes to exert its influence alongside the  
working-time, thereby limiting the amount of surplus-value realisable within a given time span.  
Still other elements derived from circulation intrude decisively into the actual production  
process. The actual process of production and the process of circulation intertwine and  
intermingle continually, and thereby invariably adulterate their typical distinctive features. The  
production of surplus-value, and of value in general, receives new definition in the process of  
circulation, as previously shown. Capital passes through the circuit of its metamorphoses.  
Finally, stepping beyond its inner organic life, so to say, it enters into relations with outer life,  
into relations in which it is not capital and labour which confront one another, but capital and  
capital in one case, and individuals, again simply as buyers and sellers, in the other. The time of  
circulation and working-time cross paths and thus both seem to determine the surplus-value.  
The original form in which capital and wage-labour confront one another is disguised through  
the intervention of relationships seemingly independent of it. Surplus-value itself does not  
appear as the product of the appropriation of labour-time, but as an excess of the selling price of  
commodities over their cost-price, the latter thus being easily represented as their actual value  
(valeur intrinsèque), while profit appears as an excess of the selling price of commodities over  
their immanent value.

True, the nature of surplus-value impresses itself constantly upon the consciousness of the  
capitalist during the process of production, as his greed for the labour-time of others, etc., has  
revealed in our analysis of surplus-value. But: 1) The actual process of production is only a  
fleeting stage which continually merges with the process of circulation, just as the latter merges  
with the former, so that in the process of production, the more or less clearly dawning notion of  
the source of the gain made in it, i.e., the inkling of the nature of surplus-value, stands at best as  
a factor equally valid as the idea that the realised surplus originates in a movement that is  
independent of the production process, that it arises in circulation, and that it belongs to capital  
irrespective of the latter’s relation to labour. Even such modern economists as Ramsay, Malthus,  
Senior, Torrens, etc., identify these phenomena of circulation directly as proofs that capital in its  
bare material existence, independent of its social relation to labour which makes capital of it, is,  
as it were, an independent source of surplus-value alongside labour and independent of labour.

2.  Under the item of expenses, which embrace wages as well as the price of raw materials, wear  
    and tear of machinery, etc., the extortion of unpaid labour figures only as a saving in paying for  
    an article which is included in expenses, only as a smaller payment for a certain quantity of  
    labour, similar to the saving when raw materials are bought more cheaply, or the depreciation of  
    machinery decreases. In this way the extortion of surplus-labour loses its specific character. Its  
    specific relationship to surplus-value is obscured. This is greatly furthered and facilitated, as  
    shown in Book I, by representing the value of labour-power in the form of wages.

56 Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy

The relationships of capital are obscured by the fact that all parts of capital appear equally as the  
source of excess value (profit).

The way in which surplus-value is transformed into the form of profit by way of the rate of  
profit is, however, a further development of the inversion of subject and object that takes place  
already in the process of production. In the latter, we have seen, the subjective productive forces  
of labour appear as productive forces of capital. On the one hand, the value, or the past labour,  
which dominates living labour, is incarnated in the capitalist. On the other hand, the labourer  
appears as bare material labour-power, as a commodity. Even in the simple relations of  
production this inverted relationship necessarily produces certain correspondingly inverted  
conceptions, a transposed consciousness which is further developed by the metamorphoses and  
modifications of the actual circulation process.

It is altogether erroneous, as a study of the Ricardian school shows, to try to identify the laws of  
the rate of profit with the laws of the rate of surplus-value, or vice versa. The capitalist naturally  
does not see the difference between them. In the formula s/C the surplus-value is measured by  
the value of the total capital advanced for its production, of which a part was totally consumed  
in this production and a part was merely employed in it. In fact, the formula s/C expresses the  
degree of self-expansion of the total capital advanced, or, taken in conformity with inner  
conceptual connections and the nature of surplus-value, it indicates the ratio of the amount of  
variation of variable capital to the magnitude of the advanced total capital.

In itself, the magnitude of value of total capital has no inner relationship to the magnitude of  
surplus-value, at least not directly. So far as its material elements are concerned, the total capital  
minus the variable capital, that is, the constant capital, consists of the material requisites – the  
means of labour and materials of labour – needed to materialise labour. It is necessary to have a  
certain quantity of means and materials of labour for a specific quantity of labour to materialise  
in commodities and thereby to produce value. A definite technical relation depending on the  
special nature of the labour applied is established between the quantity of labour and the  
quantity of means of production to which this labour is to be applied. Hence there is also to that  
extent a definite relation between the quantity of surplus-value, or surplus-labour, and the  
quantity of means of production. For instance, if the labour necessary for the production of the  
wage amounts to a daily 6 hours, the labourer must work 12 hours to do 6 hours of surplus-  
labour, or produce a surplus-value of 100%. He uses up twice as much of the means of  
production in 12 hours as he does in 6. Yet this is no reason for the surplus-value produced by  
him in 6 hours to be directly related to the value of the means of production used up in those 6,  
or in 12 hours. This value is here altogether immaterial; it is only a matter of the technically  
required quantity. It does not matter whether the raw materials or means of labour are cheap or  
dear, as long as they have the required use-value and are available in technically prescribed  
proportion to the labour to be applied. If I know that x lbs. of cotton are consumed in an hour of  
spinning and that they cost a shillings, then, of course, I also know that 12 hours’ spinning  
consumes 12x lbs. of cotton = 12 a shillings, and can then calculate the proportion of the  
surplus-value to the value of the 12 as well as to that of the 6. But the relation of living labour to  
the value of means of production obtains here only to the extent that a shillings serve as a name  
for x lbs. of cotton; because a definite quantity of cotton has a definite price, and therefore,  
conversely, a definite price may also serve as an index for a definite quantity of cotton, so long  
as the price of cotton does not change. If I know that the labourer must work 12 hours for me to  
appropriate 6 hours of surplus-labour, that therefore I must have a 12-hour supply of cotton  
ready for use, and if I know the price of this quantity of cotton needed for 12 hours, then I have  
an indirect relation between the price of cotton (as an index of the required quantity) and the  
surplus-value. But, conversely, I can never conclude the quantity of the raw material that may  
be consumed in, say, one hour, and not 6, of spinning from the price of the raw material. There  
is, then, no necessary inner relation between the value of the constant capital, nor, therefore,  
between the value of the total capital (=c+v) and the surplus-value.

If the rate of surplus-value is known and its magnitude given, the rate of profit expresses  
nothing but what it actually is, namely a different way of measuring surplus-value, its  
measurement according to the value of the total capital instead of the value of the portion of  
capital from which surplus-value directly originates by way of its exchange for labour. But in  
reality (i.e., in the world of phenomena) the matter is reversed. Surplus-value is given, but given

Capital Volume III. The Rate of Profit 57

as an excess of the selling price of the commodity over its cost-price; and it remains a mystery  
where this surplus originated – from the exploitation of labour in the process of production, or  
from outwitting the purchaser in the process of circulation, or from both. What is also given is  
the proportion of this surplus to the value of the total capital, or the rate of profit. The  
calculation of this excess of the selling price over the cost-price in relation to the value of the  
advanced total capital is very important and natural, because in effect it yields the ratio in which  
total capital has been expanded, i.e., the degree of its self-expansion. If we proceed from this  
rate of profit, we cannot therefore conclude the specific relations between the surplus and the  
portion of capital invested in wages. We shall see in a subsequent chapter what amusing  
somersaults Malthus makes when he tries in this way to get at the secret of the surplus-value and  
of its specific relation to the variable part of the capital. What the rate of profit actually shows is  
rather a uniform relation of the surplus to equal portions of the total capital, which, from this  
point of view, does not show any inner difference at all, unless it be between the fixed and  
circulating capital. And it shows this difference, too, only because the surplus is calculated in  
two ways; namely, first, as a simple magnitude – as excess over the cost-price. In this, its initial,  
form, the entire circulating capital goes into the cost-price, while of the fixed capital only the  
wear and tear goes into it. Second, the relation of this excess in value to the total value of the  
advanced capital. In this case, the value of the total fixed capital enters into the calculation, quite  
the same as the circulating capital. Therefore, the circulating capital goes in both times in the  
same way, while the fixed capital goes in differently the first time, and in the same way as  
circulating capital the second time. Under the circumstances the difference between fixed and  
circulating capital is the only one which obtrudes itself.

If, as Hegel would put it, the surplus therefore re-reflects itself in itself out of the rate of profit,  
or, put differently, the surplus is more closely characterised by the rate of profit, it appears as a  
surplus produced by capital above its own value over a year, or in a given period of circulation.

Although the rate of profit thus differs numerically from the rate of surplus-value, while surplus-  
value and profit are actually the same thing and numerically equal, profit is nevertheless a  
converted form of surplus-value, a form in which its origin and the secret of its existence are  
obscured and extinguished. In effect, profit is the form in which surplus-value presents itself to  
the view, and must initially be stripped by analysis to disclose the latter. In surplus-value, the  
relation between capital and labour is laid bare; in the relation of capital to profit, i.e., of capital  
to surplus-value that appears on the one hand as an excess over the cost-price of commodities  
realised in the process of circulation and, on the other, as a surplus more closely determined by  
its relation to the total capital, the capital appears as a relation to itself, a relation in which it, as  
the original sum of value, is distinguished from a new value which it generated. One is  
conscious that capital generates this new value by its movement in the processes of production  
and circulation. But the way in which this occurs is cloaked in mystery and appears to originate  
from hidden qualities inherent in capital itself.

The further we follow the process of the self-expansion of capital, the more mysterious the  
relations of capital will become, and the less the secret of its internal organism will be revealed.

In this part, the rate of profit is numerically different from the rate of surplus-value; while profit  
and surplus-value are treated as having the same numerical magnitude but only a different form.  
In the next part we shall see how the alienation goes further, and how profit represents a  
magnitude differing also numerically from surplus-value.
