# Definitions and Ideaologies

## Definitions

### Bourgeoisie

The bourgeois or capitalist class is defined as being the minority class the owns the means of production and whose societal concerns are preservation of private property rights and of capital to ensure their socioeconomic supremacy. A further distinction is made in the bourgeois class between the;
*haute bourgeoisie*
(industrialists, financiers, etc) and the,
*petite bourgeoisie*
(shopkeepers, the self-employed, lawyers, managers).

### The Vanguard Party

The idea that the most class conscious and politically advanced sections of the proletarian class should form organizations to draw the less class-conscious among the proletarian class towards revolutionary socialism and to serve as manifestations of proletarian political power against its class enemies. The vanguard party is not meant to be a clear leadership or central fixture of the revolutionary movement to guide it along its own ideological lines. Instead, it's meant to be a class conscious organic part of the working class.

### Revolution

Leninists recognize that capitalism can only be overthrown by means of violent revolution and not by gradual reforms. This comes from the observation that the bourgeois class ultimately has a monopoly on political power in a capitalist state and the only way to remove them (and eventually eliminate their class) is to forcefully depose them.

### Proletariat

The proletarian or working class is defined as being the majority class who does not own a means of production and whose only significant material asset is that of their [labour power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_power). Proletarians survive by selling their labour for a salary or wage. ---

## Ideaologies

*This section is under heavy  as one or more descriptions are either blatantly incorrect or not fleshed out. Anything without 'under ' beside it should be taken with a grain of salt and should be understood to be an in-progress work. Message the mods with any comments or suggestions.* ---

### Anarchism

Meaning "without rulers," Anarchism advocates a stateless, and classless society, seeing both the state and capitalism as fundamental tools for the powerful to oppress people. Believing the state to be innately oppressive, anarchists either reject the idea that a "workers' state" can exist, or believe that any such state established in the short term will devolve into tyranny in the long term. Antagonistic to all hierarchy, it advocates full social liberation. Anarchism is not, despite U.S. attitudes, chaos, and instead means to establish a well ordered and organized society, potentially to global scale, based upon voluntary organization and horizontal interaction. Marxists maintain that anarchism is too decentralized to succeed in a revolutionary context. Many theorists have claimed that anarchism is a basic expression of direct democracy, with democratic institutions organized as necessary and community control of their own affairs absolute, with the "community" potentially including a farm, town, city, region, or planet. There are many forms of Anarchism, most of which are Socialist but have small differences. ---

### Anarcho-Communism

[Anarcho-Communism][Anarcho-Communism SocWiki] is  Based on the theories of Peter Kropotkin. Like all Communism, it advocates a world, classless, stateless society in which the means of production are controlled by the workers in collective. An Anarcho-Communist revolution seeks to simultaneously abolish the state and private property, collectivizing property in the hands of the community and bringing decisions to communities and federations of communities, rather than a vanguard party. While Marxist Communism includes a period of proletarian control of the state, Anarcho Communists maintain that such state control devolves into oppression, pointing to the the purges of Stalin and other Marxist-Leninist states that did not result in communist societies. It thus differs from Marxist Communism in immediately abolishing the state while collectivizing property. Eschewing the idea of a Vanguard Party or "Professional Revolutionaries," these anarchists advocate a widespread revolution under democratic control to establish a united but decentralized world. Voluntary organizations and workers' councils are distinguishing characteristics of its communal ownership. This is often done through Anarcho-Syndicalism, which is a major anarchist tendency, usually operating with Anarcho-Communism, that uses revolutionary labor unions to set up democratic worker self-management, work on bread and butter issues, and try to build the new world in the shell of the old. ---

### Collectivist Anarchism

Based on the theories of Mikhail Bakunin. This shouldn't be confused with anarchist communism, despite the common theme of collective ownership. Under collectivism, there is no private ownership of the means of production, and all factories, farms, and workshops are collectivized. However, the division of goods is based upon time worked, rather than need. This is still upholding the wage system in a way, though not in such a way as to allow someone to grow rich and purchase means of production for others to work at. Instead, one is entitled to compensation based directly on one's own labor, and exclusively on one's own labor, and so the idea is to stop people from profiting from the labor of others. Productive property is communally owned, so all are able to work at them and the community makes all decisions in a democratic and horizontal manner. Given the retaining of compensation for time worked in an anarchist setting, some have suggested collectivism as an intermediary step to anarchist communism, as the community might move collective ownership to policies of providing for the needs of all. ---

### Communism

[Communism](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/Communism) refers to a stateless, classes, and moneyless society in which the workers cooperatively own the means of production, and also refers to the advocacy/inevitability of such a system. There are differences in ideology on how to actually achieve Communism, which is where Marxism-Leninsim, Stalinism, Maoism, and even most Socialist ideologies come into play. The most popular evidently being Reformation, or Revolution (of which Marxism-Leninism sets up as a category). Socialism is usually seen as the path towards Communism, and so most Communists can refer to themselves as Socialist. ---

### Democratic Socialism

[Under](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/DemocraticSocialism) A rather broad movement representing most socialist ideologies. The inclusion of "Democratic" in the term doesn't make other forms of socialism undemocratic, but just to denote the Democratic State that it supports. The state in Democratic Socialism exists to organize communal efforts and provide for the needs of the citizen, leading to terms like "socialized medicine." Usually the kind of thing someone is referring to when they call themselves a "socialist," especially with Socialist Parties and the like.

### Left Communism

*Left Communism* refers to a wide variety of tendencies on the Communist left that emerged from a split in the Third International (The Comintern). Left Communists believe that the Russian revolution was a proletarian revolution, but criticize the actions of the Bolsheviks. Left Communism was influenced by the ideas of [Rosa Luxemburg][Rosa Luxemburg Wiki], and the two major Left Communist theorists were [Anton Pannekoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_Pannekoek) and [Amadeo Bordiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeo_Bordiga). Other Left Communist theorists include [Otto Rühle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_R%C3%BChle), [Herman Gorter][Herman Gorter Wiki], [Sylvia Pankhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Pankhurst), [Paul Mattick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mattick), and [Gilles Dauvé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Dauv%C3%A9)

#### The Important Views of Left Communists Are

* Anti-Parlimentarism
  * Left Communists do not vote or run in elections.
* Anti-Nationalism
  * Left Communists are Internationalists and reject all "national liberation" struggles.
* Rejection of participation in reactionary trade unions.
* The view of all so-called "Socialist States" as Capitalist or State Capitalist. ---

### Leninism

*Leninism* refers to the body of political theory based around the developments to revolutionary socialism made by Russian revolutionary [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin). Leninist theory was developed under the unique conditions that faced Imperial Russia at the time, and the base concepts have been executed in various socialist revolutions and armed uprisings across the world. They are the following:

* Democratic Centralism
  * A method of party organization that establishes that freedom of political speech is legitimate until party consensus, at which point every member of the party is expected to uphold the official party line established through democratic and open debate. This concept, described well by the slogan *"Freedom in discussion, unity in action"*, was practiced heavily under Lenin's leadership. Leninism provides the basis for many developments of revolutionary socialist theory. Trotskyists, Marxist-Leninists, and Marxist-Leninist-Maoists can all be considered variants under the umbrella term of 'Leninism'
* Libertarian Socialism
  * <http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/LibertarianSocialism>
  * One of the most overlapping forms of Socialism, Libertarian Socialism rejects the form of the state in itself and capitalist relations to the means of production. Greater emphasis is placed on workers self-management of the workplace, and de-centralization of political bodies to the federal or community level. Libertarian Socialism has also typically been referred to as *Basic* Anarchism, since it places an emphasis on limiting state control. ---

### Luxemburgism

*Luxemburgism* is a variety of Orthodox Marxism born from the Second International period of Socialist organisation based upon the writings of [Rosa Luxemburg][Rosa Luxemburg Wiki]. While not a fully codified ideology as is **Leninism** there are several elements that can be traced to Luxemburg's writings and thus the ideology of *Luxemburgism*, including the following:

* The Mass Strike

  * This is a strategy also promulgated by Syndicalist groups but notable amongst Marxists, The Mass Strike (or the *General Strike*) is an action whereby all workers walk off the job in accordance with a grievance and to show solidarity with other workers. The Mass Strike is considered a powerful tool within the revolutionary struggle by showing the capitalist class that the working class is able and willing to effectively operate together and without the direction of the capitalists and their managers.

* Worker Self-Emancipation

  * Luxemburgists recognise the need for workers to emancipate themselves and thus reject vanguardism and reformism as methods empowering ever smaller sections of the working class and individuals whose class goals do not align with that of the working class.

* Anti-Nationalism

  * Luxemburgism rejects nationalism and is firmly Socialist internationalist in its leanings. Luxemburgists reject nationalism as a rejection of the national bourgeoisie and in hopes that oppressed peoples will thus unite in their shared struggle instead of separating and weakening both struggles. Luxemburgist, while not as influential as Leninism over the 20th century due to a variety of factors (including the failure of the German Revolution and the success of the Russian one) has had an impact on methodology and praxis from the second half of the 20th century on through incorporation of some of Luxemburg's ideals into other branches of not just Marxism, but Socialism as a whole.

### Marxism

*Marxism* is a worldview and a method of social and economic analysis focusing on class relations and societal conflict using a dialectical materialist view of social transformation. Marxism applies this way of thought primarily as an analysis and critique of capitalism and the role of class struggle in systemic economic change. Marxism was developed largely by German economist, sociologist, and philosopher Karl Marx with the help of Friedrich Engels in the mid to late 19th century. Marxism bases itself off of a materialist understanding of social development, taking as its starting point the necessary economic activities required to satisfy the most basic needs of human society. A materialist analysis follows that the form of economic organization or mode of production either directly creates or influences the creation of most other social phenomena - including social relations, political and legal systems, morality, and ideology. As productive forces (labour power, labour efficiency, natural development of technology) improve, existing forms of social organization begin to become more and more inefficient, these inefficiencies manifesting themselves as social contradictions in the form of *class struggle*. To understand class struggle, it's important to understand the Marxist vision of the socioeconomic class. In a capitalist society, there are two primary classes defined by their relationship to the *means of production*, or *private property* (this is distinct from *personal property*). ---

### Marxism-Leninism

A term coined by [Joseph Stalin](<http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/Joseph> Stalin); Marxism-Leninism is what most non-socialists picture when they hear the word "communist." It advocates for the [Vanguard Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/Vanguard_Party) to take control of the government to create a socialist state with a centrally-planned economy. It also advocates for a single party to be in control of the government and to develop socialism in one country. ---

### Marxism-Leninism-Maoism

*Marxism-Leninism-Maoism* is the progression of Marxist-Leninist theory based off of [Mao Tsetung Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism) that was developed after Mao's death largely by the [Revolutionary Internationalist Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Internationalist_Movement), a Maoist group of parties that included groups such as Peru's [Shining Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Path). Marxist-Leninist-Maoists view their ideology as the natural development and the higher stage of Marxism-Leninism. Like Marxist-Leninists, MLMs are authoritarian socialists that advocate [Socialism in One Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_in_One_Country) as a means of strengthening proletarian supremacy and safeguarding the revolution until such a time that global communism is possible and the state can be dissolved. There are several concepts introduced in MLM thought as a result of criticisms of Soviet socialism and observances of the Chinese condition that differentiate it from Marxism-Leninism:

* The Mass Line
  * A method of organizing the vanguard party that emphasizes active engagement with the masses in the development and understanding of revolutionary theory as it applies to that particular situation. Mao criticized Stalin for having a lack of faith in the common person and being too mechanical in his understanding of socialism. As a result, the Mass Line is a method of actively learning from the common revolutionary and applying the ideas and wishes of the masses to the revolutionary situation.
* Protracted People's War
  * A method of revolutionary warfare that involves a drawn-out struggle centered around mass public support and guerilla warfare to bleed and eventually destroy reactionary forces. Perhaps the most famous example of PPW strategy was implemented by the [Viet Cong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong) during the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War)
* Cultural Revolution
  * The idea that capitalist subversion is a threat from within the socialist state as well as without, and that an active struggle must be made to purge society and the party of internal capitalist elements. Maoists recognize the threat of party members themselves becoming a new bourgeois class, and seek to prevent this and eliminate liberal elements from the societal superstructure. *"The class struggle continues, and intensifies, under socialism."* Maoists also uphold Mao's philosophical works, most importantly [*On Contradiction*](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm) and [On Practice](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_16.htm).

### Mutualism

<http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/Mutualism>

An Anarchist school of thought, Mutualists advocate a society in which everyone might own a means of production either individually or collectively. The value of a good or service in the Free Market is based on the amount of invested labor time placed into it. Like other socialist ideologies, Mutualists oppose Private Property unless it is in use or occupation by the owner, which would otherwise make it Personal Property. ---

### Trotskyism

*Trotskyism* is a current within the Leninist tradition, which is focused primarily on the works of the the Russian Revolutionary, [Leon Trotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky). Leon Trotsky wrote in the context of the 1905 Revolution, his leadership of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War and his exile from the Soviet Union shortly after Vladimir Lenin's death. Trotsky was a critic of the Soviet regime for the years prior to and after his exile, up until his assassination in 1940. He lead a breakaway from the Communist International and founded the Fourth International, which spent its existence trying to place itself between the Comintern and Capitalist and Fascist forces, leading to its suppression on all fronts. Trotsky and Trotskyists held a position of unconditionally supporting the Soviet Union in war, and often defended people and organisations which were affiliated to the Comintern (Exception: [Third Camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_camp )). Trotsky produced various theories on the nature of revolution and societal development:

* Uneven and Combined Development
* Permanent Revolution
* Degenerated Workers' State
* The Transitional Demand
* The United Front
