	3. Full Description;
		1. r/SocialismAndCommunism is a multi-tendency subreddit and, as such, works within an obvious range of contradictions. There is a lot of room for healthy discussion with other socialists you disagree with, but bad faith attacks are not welcome.
		2. This is one of our most Fundamental Tenets of this Sub. We, as Leftists, have more in Common than not. We have all already gotten over the hump of Liberalism. We can Debate amongst each other civilly and try to convince each other through Debate, Dialectics and Historical Materialism as Principled Marxists and Honorary Scholars. 
		3. Let us keep true to our Core Struggle to Agitate the Working Class and bring about Class Consciousness through activism and agitation. We need to agitate liberals and get them to become Class Conscious so we can be debating them here as well.
		4. Don't attack comrades over differing sectarian ideologies. Logical debates using reason and Principled Argument's, otherwise just say nothing.
