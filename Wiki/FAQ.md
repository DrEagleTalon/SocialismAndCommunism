Welcome to /r/socialism . I'm sure you've been told many different things about this movement, and you want to find out some things for yourself! 

**What is Socialism?** 

Socialism is the ideological point of view that promotes the idea of workers taking and having control over their workplaces. We believe that the capitalist system of private ownership and wage-labour (more commonly referred to as wage-slavery) dehumanizes and alienates the people who work for large corporations, big businesses, etc., since selling your labour turns you into just as much of a commodity as what you produce. 
Advocates of socialism, collectively called socialists, have a wide range of beliefs on how to go about achieving a socialist society. Some believe that socialism can be achieved through reforms to our current systems of government, while others advocate absolute revolution; some believe that the state is a necessary tool in dismantling the capitalist class structure while others want the simultaneous dissolution of capitalism and the state; some believe in the abolition of money while others argue that markets are the key to socialism. One thing we can all agree on though is that people should come before profits. 

**Frequently Asked Questions about Socialism** 

Q: *Does this community support a Nordic-style welfare state?* 

A: Generally speaking, no. While the welfare state has its perks and is preferable to 'unregulated capitalism', for most of us it's seen as a temporary fix to a larger problem. Welfare does not abolish social classes or give workers more of a voice, or eliminate the grievances of imperialism. Welfare is better than nothing, however, but most view it as duct tape holding together leaky pipes. To put it another way, it treats symptoms - not the disease. &nbsp; 

Q: *If most socialists are against the concept of private property, does that mean if I built a house, would other people own it?* 

A: Of course not! There is a common misconception that private property is the same thing as personal property. When we discuss "private property," we mean things that could be used to exploit people for profit. A coal mine would be private property since the landlord would be able to extract wealth from the mine through the miners' exploitation in their labor. Remember, there's a distinction between private property, and *personal property*. Personal Property refers to property in use or occupancy. We don't want to take away your house or your car. &nbsp; 

Q: *In a Socialist society, would a doctor be paid as much as a janitor?* 

A: We favor a system where *either* everyone gets a cut of the 'profits' they rake in, or money is eradicated entirely and is replaced by a gift or planned economy. That said, socialism does not necessarily mean that each person is 'rewarded equally' for what some would consider 'unequal' labour. We're all for workers getting the credit they deserve, and high-skilled or dangerous jobs could certainly get more out of a hypothetical socialist society. Consider the Ricardian Socialist economic statement -- *['to each according to his contribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_each_according_to_his_contribution)*. That is, a doctor 'contributes more' to society than that of a janitor, and therefore the doctor gets more than the janitor, based on a likely flat basis - both need a home, probably a car, etc. The doctor, however, might get nicer items, and so on. When it comes to the concept of *pay* many think of it as intrinsic to money, when there can many alternatives ranging from currency that deteriorates in value the longer it is held, to the credit system usually seen in sci-fi movies, though this issue can't be fully tackled without getting into the very concept of *pay*. Some socialists, however, ultimately subscribe to the concept of [*'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need'*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_need) - a view that mandates only that each individual provide what they can to society and take back what they need from the abundance of goods that would theoretically exist in such a system. &nbsp; 

Q: *Why will people work? What will stop the lazy from just slacking off and expecting to be paid anyway?* 

A: Look back in history. All of the Paleolithic and a good bit of the neolithic era communities are run off a system very similar to socialism. Why did people work? Well, what else would they do? Honestly, have you ever tried to do absolutely nothing for a long amount of time? Even in a capitalist society that encourages people to make the most money with the least amount of effort I find it really hard not to do something productive with my time. But that’s just it, humans are wired to do something. We [strive to solve problems and better ourselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgKKPQiRRag). Even without the incentive of higher pay, most doctors would still practice (maybe not as many hours), architects would still make building, I would still study History. The combination of a strive to create with the general mindset of helping the community that helps you, like a debt that is constantly being paid back to the society that keeps you alive, would insure productivity. In Marxism, there's a term called, "The Base and the Superstructure," meaning the Base (economic means of production and distribution) affect the Superstructure (Culture, way of thought, interaction and relationship with each other and the economy). Under a capitalist system where humans are forced into a rat race, we do whatever it takes to make money; while under a socialist system, profit isn't the main incentive, you receive from society based on if you give or not. People under a socialist system would work cooperatively, and in turn, act more responsibly (cooperatively). Innovation is a drive that can't be weighed down by money, people can build/achieve whatever they want if they have the support from others. This is why Socialism is not just an economic system, but a socio-economic system. &nbsp; 

Q: *Is religion compatible with socialism?* 

A: Socialists and Anarchists have been fighting against organized religion for a while now, but that doesn't make them anti-religious. The problem resides in organized religion’s orientation to systems of wealth and power. In history you see the Spanish Anarchists attacking the Catholic Church during the early 20th century and Marxist Russians attacking the Orthodox Church of Russia. It wasn't because of a hatred of religion; it was because those institutions used religion to justify their hold on political, social, and economic power at the time. &nbsp; 

Q: *This is all fine and good, but has socialism every actually worked?* 

A: Users in this subreddit will cite a plethora of various attempts such as Revolutionary Catalonia, Republican Spain, various historical periods of the USSR, Zapatista-controlled Mexico, Rojava, the Paris Commune, etc. It would be disingenuous of this wiki to answer this question definitively without introducing the bias of a particular tendency. This is perhaps the most controversial topic in this community. Only research on your part will satisfy this answer and we encourage you to do so lest we devolve into dogmatism. &nbsp; Q: *So do you think that the government should control all businesses?* A: This depends on which socialist you ask. A distinction must be made between the "government" and the state. The government, in socialist thought, is the people organizing society. The state apparatus on the other hand, is the judiciary, the police, the military, the tax bureaus i.e. the tools of the bourgeoisie. With regard to the **state**, the Leninist variety believes that in order to achieve communism, worker control of the state will control businesses during the early stage of socialism (*State and Revolution*). Other tendencies such as the plethora of anarchist schools of thought do not want state control of any part of society. We encourage you to consult the Suggest Reading List or the community on such a complex topic. &nbsp; 

Q: *Are you guys a weirdo cult of Soviet sympathizers?* 

A: Most people on here, if they sympathize with the old Soviet Union at all (kind of a minority really), tend to be bigger fans of its early days--when the workers had more power over the workplace and government. Most people on here tend not to be so thrilled about it when you look at the years that Stalin was in power. In fact, the term 'Stalinist' exists primarily as a pejorative description of what many view as the completely anti-socialist policies of the USSR at this point. Occasionally someone will come along who says "Stalin did nothing wrong and has been vilified by the media". This is, for the most part, considered a fringe view around here resulting only in some boring and fruitless flame wars. Same rule applies as above. &nbsp; 

Q: *What did Marx really mean when he said, "Religion is the opiate of the masses."?* 

A: Well it's important to put Marx's quote into historical context. At the time, an opiate was a pain reliever, not a recreational drug. So Marx is saying that religion acts as a pain reliever for the isolation and alienation that capitalist society creates. &nbsp; 

Q: *Okay, I'm interested. I want to know more.* 

A: In that case let me direct you to our [list of ideologies](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/List_of_Ideologies). I like to tell people "Ten socialists in a room, twenty different opinions." so the only way to get the full picture is to read up, learn, and think
