# Socialism Starter Study Guide Resources and Discussion Questions

## Introduction
***

'Socialism', in addition to being the name of the mode of production that follows and displaces capitalism, is an umbrella term. The r/socialism community encompasses many different strands within the socialist movement. While the different tendencies may agree on much, there are also perspectives, tactics and areas of emphasis that are in contradiction with oneanother. You will briefly encounter these debates within this starter pack.

Yet there is nothing to be lost by studying arguments you disagree with. In fact, important conclusions often crystallise in the heat of debate. This starter pack only aims to provide an introduction to socialism, and therefore only includes a brief glimpse, rather than an [in-depth study](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/suggested_readings), of how different socialist orientations emerge, diverge, clash, and intersect.

The following introductory videos and readings will dispel some common myths about socialism and introduce the basic terms and concepts that are necessary for understanding socialist literature. If you find you are having difficulty with these concepts, r/Socialism_101 is always available to answer your questions. Theory informs our positions, and history teaches us how to learn from the present. Above all, organize, and apply what you learn about the world in order to change it.

## Philosophy
***
&nbsp;

***An introductory talk by John Molyneux*** offers an overview of the differences between bourgeois philosophy and Marxism, and briefly explains its applicability to working class struggle.  In Chapter II of ***Socialism: Utopian and Scientific***, Engels gives a historical account of the development of Marx's dialectics (also referred to as "dialectical materialism" or "materialist dialectics"), and explains its relationship to its philosophical predecessors. A short section from ***Capital*** explains commodity fetishism and its implications for capitalist society, and selections from an ***essay by Thomas Weston*** explain two crucial components of materialist dialectics: the unity of opposites and contradiction.

r/Socialism does not necessarily endorse any organisations mentioned in the materials.

### **Questions**
***

## Racism and Nationalism
***

The articles for this study group aim to give firstly a general introduction to the concept of
racism from a Marxist/socialist perspective. The articles by Kim and Bohmer draw upon
examples in which racist ideologies manifest themselves and reveal how they relate to the
broader class contradictions in society. Bohmer’s article places racism in an economic
context by touching upon its relevance with regard to labour markets and employment.
The last two articles by Miles and Balibar shed light on the tight relationship between
racism and nationalism by providing historical analyses ranging from Nazism, Colonialism
and the British Nationalist sentiment expressed by the Conservative Party under
Thatcherism.
