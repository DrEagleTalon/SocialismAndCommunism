azureScapegoat’s Reading Guide

For Beginners

Most of these are classics from a hundred years ago,

as they’re the texts all modern books about socialism are based on.

Without reading these, chances are you will lack

critical information going into any more modern theory.

Introductory texts

Even the reading guide for beginners has to have an introductory section. These texts are even shorter than the other books/articles on this list, and shouldn’t be skipped.

[Why Socialism?](https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/) by Albert Einstein

A short essay written by Albert Einstein for the Monthly Review in 1949, outlining the basic problems with capitalism and lays out why socialism as a socioeconomic system solves these problems. A great text for people who haven’t read theory before.

[The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/x01.htm) by Vladimir Lenin

An article written by Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin in 1913. It’s only a page long so reading it can’t hurt you. In short it explains how Marxism as a worldview consists of three main components: English political economy, German philosophical materialism, and French socialism.

Marxian Economics

Perhaps the most vital component of Marxism to understand, Karl Marx’s critique of the political economy has undoubtedly been of vital importance to socialists all over the world. Unfortunately it can also be one of the more difficult components to understand, as Marx often wrote in turgid prose. The following items are introductory texts to Marxian economics.

[Value, Price and Profit](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/) by Karl Marx

A relatively short book on the basics of capitalist economics by Karl Marx. Often read together with “Wage-labour and Capital”.

[Wage-labour and Capital](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/) by Karl Marx

See “Value, Price and Profit”

[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/)

by Vladimir Lenin

This 1917 book by Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin is one which is perhaps even more relevant in our own times than it was when it was written. It describes the function of financial capital in generating profits from imperialist colonialism as the final stage of capitalist development to ensure greater profits.

Marxist Philosophy

Not everyone likes philosophy, but it’s an important component of Marxism, and without a good grasp on the concept of scientific socialism, German materialism, and Hegelian dialectics, you can hardly call yourself a true Marxist!

[The German Ideology](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm)

by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels

Perhaps the most important book for Marxist philosophy ever written, “The German Ideology” contains vital information which any aspiring Marxist needs to learn. From how we humans have distinguished ourselves from other animals to how the ruling class dictates which ideals and morals are allowed to be considered “reasonable” in our society, this book tackles it all.

[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/)

by Friedrich Engels

An extract from the book [“Anti-Dühring”](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/) by the same author (which you may also want to read, but it can be a bit heavy at times). The text was written to be a “small popular explanatory pamphlet” as a way to popularise his colleague Karl Marx’s turgid prose.

[Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/index.htm)

by Friedrich Engels

As exciting as it sounds.

Marxist Politics

To critique the current system and to philosophise about dialectics is one thing, but how does any of this work in practice? That is the question the following texts set out to answer.

[The Civil War in France](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/)

by Karl Marx

A pamphlet on the importance of the struggle of the communards against the French Armed Forces. The Paris Commune (18 March – 28 May 1871) was the first attempt at a socialist revolution in modern history. For the first time, ideas which had until now only existed on paper were to be put to practice. Alas, the Parisians learned a valuable lesson - the rich and powerful won’t simply give up their power willingly, and will resort to bloody violence if necessary to protect their wealth.

[Manifesto of the Communist Party](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/)

by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels

The ‘Manifesto of the Communist Party’, also known simply as the ‘Communist Manifesto’, is a contender for the most influential book in human history alongside the Bible and the writings of Confucius.

Personally I don’t think it’s much better or worse than any other of Marx’s writings, but this is the one everyone has read.

From European socialists and social democrats to the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, this short little manifesto has changed the world forever.

[Critique of the Gotha Program](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm)

by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels

Offering perhaps Marx's most detailed pronouncement on programmatic matters of revolutionary strategy, the document discusses the "dictatorship of the proletariat", the period of transition from capitalism to communism, proletarian internationalism and the party of the working class.

[What Is To Be Done?](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/)

by Vladimir Lenin

Subtitled “The Burning Questions of our Movement”, this 1901 book lays out the argument for a revolutionary workers’ party to herd the vast proletarian masses toward the mutual goal of abolishing capitalism. A controversial piece, even among Marxist circles, its conclusion can be debated but its usefulness in helping us understand Leninism as an ideology is not. Certainly an interesting read.

[The State and Revolution](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/)

by Vladimir Lenin

What is the role of the state under socialism? Can democratic socialism really abolish capitalism?

[Social Reform or Revolution?](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/index.htm)

by Rosa Luxemburg

Often called simply “Reform or Revolution?”, this 1899 book by Polish-German Marxist theorist Rosa Luxemburg is widely regarded as one of the most important works in orthodox Marxism. She argues that capitalism is economically unsustainable and will eventually collapse and that a revolution is necessary to transform capitalism into socialism.

[Capital](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/) by Karl Marx

Capital, or Das Kapital in its original German, is the magnum opus of Karl Marx’s critique of political economy. It is heavily recommended that you read it, but it is certainly not an easy task. You may wonder why it appears in this reader’s guide “for beginners”, but the truth is that if you want to gain a complete understanding of Marxism, reading and understanding Marx’s Capital is the only way. The Communist Manifesto was, by Marx’s own admission, written for a specific time and place and quickly became outdated. It is also not really sufficient to merely read excerpts of Capital, as the book is written to be a complete “dissection of the onion” (as David Harvey puts it) that is the political economy.

In 1872, when asked by his editor if the French edition ought to be published in a serialized manner, chapter-by-chapter (as the French liked to read their books at the time), Marx wrote that although this would perhaps make the work more accessible for the everyday person, it would also break up what was written to be a complete work.

“There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summit.”

-   Karl Marx, preface to the French edition of Capital, 1872.

Reading Capital is not something you do in an afternoon, and I’m not putting it on this list to frighten anyone, but merely as a reminder that the best understanding of Marx (and indeed of capitalism) will ultimately come from reading Capital, back to back.
